I made myself sick and went to a dark place. I was so tired and frustrated with myself because I couldn't meet the impossible and unrealistic expectations I set for myself. I felt like a total failure.   I arrived at my psychologist a total trainwreck. I hadn't slept in 3 days and had completely lost my mind. I couldn't stop. I would have cancelled my appointment but they have a 24 hour policy.   My psychologist had a great analogy... ""I went outside to shovel snow. I kept shovelling and shovelling but it kept snowing and snowing and so I shovelled faster and faster. But there was a blizzard and the snow was coming harder and faster and so I shovelled harder and faster, and still the snow kept falling. And everyone around me kept telling me to rest, but how could I rest? Can't you see its snowing? I had to keep going, I had to shovel harder and faster and better and I could not see the hole I had dug for myself with this never ending snow and on and on. But what I really had to do... was stop shovelling.""  So I finally stopped shovelling. It was really hard. Just. Stop. Shovelling. She wanted me to promise that I would take a break until next week. I couldn't agree for a whole week, but I did agree to take a few days. That I would take my meds. And sleep. We practiced what I would say to the person I'm volunteering for who is totally frustrated with me. So I took my meds and I went to sleep.   I felt better after 14 hours of sleep. I met with my nurse therapist and I had to tell her about my awful weekend. I was ashamed that I let myself get so sick. She asked me about the self-harm and I had to tell her cause I seem to be incapable of lying. She took my knife. I feel lost without it. I know I can just go and buy a new one. But I will try not to. Until I am a little more stable.   I know it's hard for husband to watch me lose my mind like that. We talked about making an appointment with my social worker to make a mad map. It's basically a written contract that we agree on for when I go crazy and am unable to make rational decisions. The idea is to be an active participant in my recovery before I lose my shit and so my husband doesn't feel like such as asshole when I am not compliant.

23,MentalHealthSupport,I've been having a horrible recurring dream.,jacksongray213,1,"(Just an FYI I've posted this in other places but I'm new to Reddit and I'm not sure where this best fits)  Hey there guys, for the past month or so I have a reoccurring dream that happens probably once every 2-3 nights. It's really starting to drive me crazy. Just a heads up, this dream is pretty inappropriate and has a lot of gross and graphic things happening so if you don't want to read something like that, please move on.  Basically what happens is I start out in a dark room, then some women come in and they hit me and strip me naked. I get taken into a room full of what seems to be hundreds of very beautiful women. Like each one is absolutely stunning. Then my hands and feet are tied to a table that is vertical against the wall, both feet on the bottom corners and both hands on the top corners. All of the women take turns coming up to me and touching my penis and testicles.   My penis is very undersized, and it's definitely my biggest insecurity and it has been for a while. As much as it pains me to admit it, I know that strangers are reading this so it's okay to admit, but when soft my penis is a little less than an inch long. And throughout the dream it stays that way. The women touch it and the entire room just roars with laughter constantly. They make me look them in the eye the whole time while they touch it. I'm bombarded with insults and jokes that really make me upset. I start crying and I don't stop throughout the entire dream.   At some point one of them takes my penis and aims it towards me, and they make me pee on myself. After that they untie me and take me to another table where they tie my wrists to my feet together so that my butt is exposed and sticking up in the air. They then all take turns touching my anus. Then one of them ties string around my penis very tightly and my penis falls off, even though I don't experience any pain. And the area it comes off is just naturally healed, like I never had a penis in the first place. A blonde woman, it's the same woman every time, takes it and rubs it all over my lips, and then inserts it into my butt, pushing it in and out and all the women start chanting ""Quit fucking yourself"", and then she finally just leaves it in there. Then I'm untied and flipped over, and a woman comes up with a knife and says it's time to cut off ""my tiny little pebbles"". She then swings down to cut off my testicles, and right before it happens I wake up.  It's the same dream every time. I've had recurring dreams before when I was little but nothing like this. It happens so often that I dread going to sleep at night and I have even pulled all-nighters just so there's no chance I'll have to experience that dream.  It's really starting to take a toll on my personal life. Every pretty girl I see I think that they were in my dream. I can't even have conversations with attractive women anymore. I can't stop thinking about the insults towards my penis and I don't even want to look at it anymore. I want to get professional help, but I'm a college student already knee deep in student loans and I live on a purely ramen noodle and water diet so I have no idea where I would come up with the money for that. My parents are already nearly broke and the last thing I want to do is ask them for money.  I'm not sure what I can do. Just writing this out has made me feel better, it feels nice finally being able to share what I'm going through. My older sister is my best friend and I tell her everything, but I figure that if I told her about it she would prod me for details of the dream and I really would rather not share what happens in my dream with her.   If you've read through all of this, I want to thank you. I guess I'm trying to see if there's anyone out there that can help me get rid of this reoccurring nightmare, or at least help me come up with some way to cope with it.

59,MentalHealthSupport,Is this feeling most likely the meds or should I seek alternative help?,triadne,1,"Hi,  I could  really befit from some guidance or reassurance or some insight.   Ok, so I was on sertraline for a few years. I think it's called zoloft in the USA and other places.   ------------------------------- **^i'll ^add ^a ^sort ^of ^tldr ^after ^this ^paragraph.**   What I want to ask about is specific. sertraline kept me pretty much stable for a few years. recently a few things happened. I lost my grandparents for a start. I didn't really have too much of an issue dealing with that. I think it may have stuck with me though, maybe suppressed by the meds. then I rehomed my pet cat due to issues I was having with him. maybe those issues were related to my loss. not sure. but when i rehomed him, I fell to pieces and had to get him back. from that point, I did not get better. it seemed like maybe I needed an increase or at least so said my doctor. I went with the recommendation. got bad for a while because that's what happens. then the medds worked. but this time they seemed to fail on odd days. long after the allotted time for adjustment, I would have days where I would just fall apart again. and it would take a few days before i recovered again.  through that period, I had a few epiphanies and learnt to control suicidal thoughts and realised it wasn't an answer. even when feeling the worst I'd felt in a long time, I realised that I have no control over where I go after death so it would be a massive risk. not an easy way out. a potential disaster resulting in even worse suffering. Anyhow, to get to hte point, I realised that the drugs were not doing me any favours. they were severely restricting neuro plasticity and preventing me from learning effectively, and preventing me from developing new strategies for dealing with life issues.  I decided the meds were more harm than good. I have also become convinced that the meds are not really helping me to deal with life, and actually possibly causing various issues. I'd been experiencing periods of extreme anxiety and depression with no apparent cause. I would do all the right things, go out and meet people, do some volunteering, improve others lives, have a good (not too busy) schedule, feed myself well, do some working out etc. I would do all the right things and still have unexplainable depression. not even triggered by anything. So I think it's the meds.  So now I've come pas the end of a reasonable taper. I was on 100mg and I tapered 2 weeks. maybe at the end i jumped the gun a bit and i do have symptoms. I have dizziness.  maybe my sleep is disturbed too.  I guess I do feel quite tired.  anyway, last couple days I've been struggling a bit, feeling depressed over the last hour or so for no apparent reason. night before last, I got anxiety from thinking about whether or not my cat was sleeping on my bed. really no reason why I would feel anxious because of that.   ----------------------------------- **^so ^now ^a ^sort ^of ^tldr**  So, after all that long explanation... has anyone tapered off their sertraline and experienced this? I'm pretty sure it's standard, but I'm making a correlation between the unexplained depression before I came off and after i came off. is this likely to be the very same thing? or could it be that I have an unresolved issue that I cannot see and it was just the medication failing to mask it?

72,MentalHealthSupport,Annoying inconvenient sporadic suicidal thoughts.,imkindastrange,1,"TW: sexual/verbal/physical abuse, depression, self harm, and dark thoughts. I don't go int excruciating. Detail though.   So I just came from dance class. Aka one of the few places I feel free and safe from all the horrible things that are happening outside. My life is the best it's ever been and I am the all-around healthiest I've ever been, but that's not saying much.  But for some reason, I find myself now switching from the mode of feeling jubilant around people that have honestly changed and potentially saved my life to being depressed and suicidal around my abusive family.  I am not in the place to escape my abusive situation, so that is off the table. I am 17 years old and just graduated from high school and I plan to break the cycle. But for the next few years I must suffer.  I have a history of physical, sexual, and verbal abuse. Verbal and some of the physical comes from my home but the sexual abuse and everything else comes from other places. It's not as bad as it used to be and the only place I am for the most part is home. But I carry the burden of severe trauma. I likely have PTSD along with a slew of other mental disorders but I am undiagnosed so I am not 100% sure.   So here I am wanting to self harm again. I don't cut myself. I either bang my head against the wall or scratch at myself. It's not the pain I'm after. It's the release of energy and rage. In fact I hate the pain part. Punishing myself is not a driving factor but it's kind of a little in the background I guess.   I'm just here looking for some tips on what to do when I suddenly switch from happy to suicidal and depressed. It's nothing I can't handle. I'm used to it and I'm a fighter. I will 100% survive this situation so please don't worry too much. The worst is over. But some tips to make it even easier would help.   I am currently hating myself and assuming that all the people I talked to tonight don't give a shit about me. My mind does this thing where I pick apart each and every tiny part of every social situation and make ridiculous inferences on what was going on.

74,MentalHealthSupport,I am actively trying to stop self harming but it's not working.,imkindastrange,1,"SERIOUS TW. PLEASE DO NOT KEEP READING IF SELF HARM OR SUICIDE IS AT ALL TRIGGERING TO YOU.  I don't cut myself or do anything so serious. Usually I claw at my arms or legs and sometimes it's done in such a fit of rage that it leaves a pretty bad scrape but nothing worse than ""I fell off my bike and skidded a bit on the concrete"" type of cuts. Or sometimes they go away within a day. But it's still self harm. I also get the urge to pull my hair sometimes but mostly it's slamming my head against the wall. I haven't done those in a very long time. I'm trying hard not to as I don't want to hurt myself. As bad as clawing at my arms is, I'd rather that than brain damage. I hate to say this, but it's the healthier alternative when I physically cannot stop myself.  Today the girls at the camp I work for kept running their fingers on a cut I have all the way across my arm that's pretty much scanned and almost healed. It was the first time I self harmed in probably like a month (which is pretty good) and it was in a blind fit of terror and I really hurt myself but after a few days it's starting to go away.  But they keep mentioning the cuts or striking them and in their head I think there showing me love but it's just really unsettling and it breaks my heart. And I'm crying just thinking about it because they have no idea how they got there. I never want those kids to have to go through the horrors I have gone through.  I've been sexually, physically, and verbally abused. All three types of abuse have happened out of the home, and in the home, only physical and verbal abuse occur. I am not mentally stable at times. I'm in a better place that I used to be but just now my mom pressured me to do college tasks when I have been spending the night sitting in my bed mourning friends who have abandoned me and my friend who died and things that used to be happy that are now sad. And so when she looked away I quickly scratched my left hand hard. And you can't tell that it's self harm when it's just a scratch.  It is unsafe for me to tell anyone that I have a self harm problem right now. I am unable to get out of my abusive home situation. I'm struggling to hang on.  Please, give me some advice on how I can stop self harming. I don't wanna hurt myself. It's not the pain I'm after. It's the cathartic release that I crave desperately that NONE of the standard remedies provide like punching a pillow. The only thing that works is rubbing lipstick all over my arms but that takes sometimes over an hour to clean up and still Im covered in makeup and I am too depressed to move my body that much right now. And to be honest it's too much of an ordeal.  Please help me. I'm 17 years old and I'm trying to raise myself but I don't know what to do. I'm really lost and I don't like how it stings when I hurt myself. It makes me cry to see the scratches on my body. Even though I frequently feel suicidal, after I self harm, all I do is cry and kiss my scratches and rub it and apologize to my arm for hurting it and talk to myself and try to console myself but it's really hard to do. Please help me, I'm really broken right now. I miss my old friends and I miss my friend who died and I am sad and drowning in guilt and sorrow and heartbreak and emptiness. And I just need some tips on how I can stop self harming  I'm sorry if this is a long confusing paragraph. I don't have the mental strength to read through it again and correct grammar errors or consolidate it right now. Trust me, if I had the ability to get help, I would be in therapy right now but I can't. So I'm doing my best and working with what I've got and desperately trying to hold on.

89,MentalHealthSupport,Am I crazy or just unfiltered?,VoxIsNy,1,"I don't know which aspect to begin in. I'll start with anger. Basically I have an obsessive desire to break, and destroy things when I'm either unsatisfied or feel like a failure. Little things from video games to school work, to bumping my elbow on a door. Just today I lost a fight in a video game to an AI and absolutely lost my shit (I felt as if my skills deminshed by two fold over night) and I started hitting kicking and throwing my PS4 (yes I had a warranty thank god) and it just kept escalating to the point I picked up an office chair and was about to smash it on the console, mind you the same chair I broke last night by smashing it into my floor successfully putting a hole in my floor. Another example, was a little road rage incident where I was calm but someone was mad enough to follow me to my house and I heard them yelling from outside my garage so I grabbed my pocket knife and ran outside to only see him driving off. But that wasn't a big deal for me besides I was so willing to just take a slice at his throat, not even a good 'ol boxing match in my front yard. But I proceeded to want to find his car at night and light it a blaze and watch it explode, after those thoughts faded I thought "" I have enough money to get a shotgun right now and just blast him and his family or maybe light there house on fire. Also last week my typical route home was blocked by homeless bum fucks doing a protest, I figured out who organized the event and pretty much had the point of genocide or imprisonment towards the homeless in my town. When I get really angry I think about just driving and side swiping cars or hitting those stupid bicyclists that ride in the road and use their fucking hand like a blinker. But besides my raging violent outbursts, homicidal and genocidal thoughts, I also have extreme suicidal thoughts. When I was younger I tried on several occasions but now I'm at the point I either go all the way with a fool proof attempt (trains, guns, cyanide) or not at all. But I shut down completely. If I'm at work I ask to go home, if I'm at college I get up and leave, if I'm at home I stare off and seem like a vegetable, stop eating. I just will chain smoke cigarettes till my checking account is empty. I also have extreme social anxiety.

I've been off work for a year, have been looking for a job for the past few months and find the intense anxiety that comes with the interview process is extremely draining.  It's taken me two weeks to put the last interview behind me. Video games have given me great distraction to escape racing thoughts. But for me too much avoidance definitely lowers my mood and contributes to dissociation.  I find that after I've been triggered I need a bit of distraction to stop my anxiety from spiraling. It's not helpful to push myself too much when in a heightened state of reactivity. Once it has calmed down a bit I can sense when distraction from current anxiety becomes avoidance of anticipated future anxiety. At this point I know I'm ready to push myself a bit more to accomplish goals.  Overall, job searching and being interviewed are my biggest triggers. I have a couple volunteer positions which has helped tremendously. It gets me out of the house, makes me feel valued, and gives me practice building up my tolerance to work even though it's unpaid.

110,MentalHealthSupport,Lonely at University,imkindastrange,1,"Long story short... Home is a bad place for me. Parents are verbally abusive, neglectful, and occasionally physically abusive (not enough that CPS would do anything about it though) and I encountered a lot of physical, sexual, and verbal abuse from people outside of the home so I have pretty bad trauma.  I started taking dance last year and for the first time, made friends. Like, REAL ones. For the first time. And my dance teacher gave me all these amazing opportunities! I even got to meet Bill Clinton at one of our performances together. Slowly, he became the father I always wanted. He knows about my family to an extent and I have gone to him and received comfort in coping with my sexual abuse related trauma.  There’s some other people back home that are pretty great too, but it’s not as relevant to the story. Just know that I have bit of a support system who kind of knows how bad my situation is, so they can kind of understand why I act the way I do.  I met a boy this summer, and I won’t say his name because he uses reddit and I’m kinda terrified that he will read this... but just know, he was amazing. You see, when you are as traumatized as I am, especially from sexual abuse, no matter how good you are at concealing it in every day life, it 100% shows through in relationships. Because of this, I made a few mistakes in behavior that I simply cannot control because of what I’ve been through. Anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, sexual abuse, self harm, a shitty family... it weighs on you. And looking back on all the telltale signs I displayed to him makes me very very sad.  But he saw them, and he didn’t look down on me. He was one of the most remarkable beings I’ve ever met. How can a boy be that mature and understanding at 19??!!  And when you finally find someone, it fucks everything up because it just emphasizes how bad your trauma and baggage really is.  He was amazing, and completely understanding, but it was too soon and I found it impossible not to show him my past, even though I never told him straight out. He definitely at least figured out a part of it.  How could he not when I was visually terrified whenever he got close? Or when I screamed and blurted out “I thought you were going to grab my vagina” when he just playfully lunged at me.  But that boy... wow.  He made it clear that he wasn’t going to hurt me. He told me that in the most loving way, and even started a conversation about what my boundaries are so that he wouldn’t trigger any of my anxiety. He has anxiety too so he gets it.  I mean, I’ve had crushes before but this was... real. I can’t explain it, but we got each other. We were only actively speaking for a period of two weeks and then it all went to shit, but in those two weeks, this boy taught me so much and made me see the world in the most wonderful way.  I look at my surroundings in a different way because I was blessed with the privilege of spending time with him. I am a better person because he was in my life.  If he hadn’t broken my heart, he would’ve been the first to break down my walls. I love him (notice how I didn’t say ”in love.” There’s difference) and will ALWAYS love him.  Then he stopped talking to me because he was leaving soon and a few other complicated reasons but it was generally just really sad. It was not because he stopped liking me. We were very much falling for each other.  I never got to say goodbye. I never even kissed him!!! Or held his hand. He would’ve been my first kiss.  The reason why was because of how terrifying my trauma made this experience.  And now he’s thousands of miles away, and I’m in college. We probably won’t talk again for a long long while.  When I was in high school, I dreamed of being here, away from my horrible family and all of the people that have hurt me in my town. I even got into an a cappella group!! If I told myself that a few years ago, my younger self would cry Happy tears. That was her dream.  But you don’t understand, man. It’s not like I thought it would be here. I mean I knew it wouldn’t be perfect, but I didn’t think it would be this lonely.   In the last year back home, between my dance studio, my friends, and this boy, I developed something to miss.  While home life was horrendous and made me constantly want to die, I had that escape, and here, I just don’t.  All I have are memories and dreams of going back home. And granted, I would much rather be here in college because Home is horrible, but there’s just nobody here who I have a deep connection with yet. It’s lonely, and there’s only one person I’ve actually semi-bonded with. But it’s not anything like what I have back home. Most other people just make me feel sad because they don’t really care about me. I haven’t self harmed in over two weeks, which is huge for me!!! But the thing is, it’s really hard not to because the people that I used to not self harm for are miles and miles away and honestly, they don’t answer my calls as much as I wish they did. Not all of them, but a good portion.  My dance teacher is horrible at replying. He cares, but he’s just doing a shitty job at staying in touch. I will talk to him about it when I get back home, but right now, I’m just hurting a lot. Keep in mind, I see him as my father, and to have close to zero contact with him breaks me.  The first boy who EVER made me feel safe is in a different country and doesn’t want to talk to me, my dance teacher doesn’t answer me that  much, and the vast majority of people I talk to here regard me as a last option. It’s lonely.  I’m honestly just very very depressed and suicidal. That’s been a common thing ever since I even knew what suicide was as a child, but it’s worsening again. I’m reverting back into old ways because it feels like all of my life before senior year... with little to no people who even remotely cared. Sometimes, I can’t even count the amount of times I think of killing myself in a day because I simply constantly have the urge. Like, every second.  This isn’t even scratching the surface of everything. I’m trying to be brief but there’s just so much.  Any love would be appreciated. I really could use a hug right about now.

If I told you the whole of it, you would be so shocked, lol. I understand that professionals are the only people I should expect to fully know how to handle my situation.  And thanks, man. It honestly doesn’t feel like that anymore. I can’t really explain why. My mind is starting to give up, and I’m actively combatting that. Life has been WAY WAY WAY worse than it is now. Honestly, aside from the loneliness and abandonment, this is the best my life has been, so I’m very thankful.  I’m sorry to hear you’ve gone through such rough times, and I’m very glad you’re in a better place now. ❤️ I wish you only the best.  And thank you for telling me that. I really have met cool people, but they’re just not here right now. I just think that sometimes, people don’t fully understand how much they are hurting me. That’s why I’m gonna talk to my dance teacher. He knows some of my situation, but I don’t think he quite knows how important he is to me. I mean, we say I love you to each other like family, but I don’t think he has put 2 and 2 together and realized that he is one of very few adult role models I have had in my life that have stayed consistent. I promise you that man would do anything for me. He has done a lot already. He is not just a dance teacher. I’m not trash talking him here at all. Sometimes, the people we love are flawed, and that’s ok.  And yeah, people at university are not the cool ones. Aside from that one person who I have started to bond with (and potentially her friend as well), people don’t treat me like I’d wished they did. It’s weird because I’m a “social butterfly”(the exact words of the boy from this summer lol), so it’s not like I’m not constantly introducing myself to people. It’s just that very few of them are respectful to me.  Tomorrow, I will be going to my school’s vegan clubs For the first time so hopefully I’ll make some friends there! It’s difficult to make friends when you’re this depressed but I will make sure to meditate before I go if I’m feeling down. I’ll go with a positive attitude, an open mind, and no expectations.  Currently im injured so I can’t dance but I’ll hopefully be dancing again next semester! That’s probably another reason why I’m depressed. Back home, I would forget about everything while I was dancing and now that I don’t have that right now, having escape is a bit trickier.  There’s counseling, but unfortunately my school only allows 10 sessions over 4 years. I recently found out that news and honestly, it’s really heartbreaking because my school misled me and made me think I would have consistent counseling. I was desperately looking forward for that, as I did not have access to counseling at home because of my family.   But I’m gonna make use of the therapy I have and hopefully get diagnosed with the disorder I suspect I have. I’m not sure what I’m going to do next, but at least I hav SOME therapy available. Aside from that, I don’t really know how much support is available at my school. I would have to check.

117,MentalHealthSupport,Advice/Question/Emotional Rant,Raven_Helena_Black,1,"I don't want to whine or sound like a horrible person, but I'm afraid of ""getting better"" from my mental illnesses and disorders. I have had many different mental disorders my entire life....depression, anxiety, aspergers, ADHD and ODD, and possibly Bipolar Disorder (currently have doctors on the fence about that one). At age 6 I had an event happen that left me PTSD, disassociation, and mild self-esteem issues became self-loathing and disgust (many of these things solidified by a few relatives, though I doubt they meant too much harm - I still cut contact with those few at this point). I've been on medications for depression and mood disorders for most of my life...before that I was on ADHD medications that induced SERVIER depressive episode (all under the age of 10). I am 26 now and currently between psych doctors after my last one decided to walk out on our scheduled appointments, marking me as the ""no-show""...if I did see him, my concerns were brushed of and ignored (my meds sucked and he didn't seem to give a shit, telling me he doesn't think adjusting them is a good idea while cutting me off when I'd try to explain why I needed change). My mom found a doctor somewhat near me that does different brain scans to assist in diagnosis and treatment. Having never known life without some form of mental illness and autism, I'm actually afraid that this may work extremely well. I've grown up with these disorders. I've learned how to approach life with these disorders.   What if I'm all but ""cured""?(I am aware mental illness is incurable. I do not know how else to describe this part of my fears) What is it like to not always feel some degree of depression or anger? A lot of my actual interests and life's dreams stem from having depression....what happens if I don't feel that more often than feeling it? Is it weird to be afraid of being happy? Don't get me wrong, I do need help....I can't usually get put of bed currently...but why is being stable rather than happy wrong? I've been told stable is a ""good starting point before reaching for happiness"" but why can't stable just be my only treatment goal? Honestly, sometimes having symptoms relieved can make me feel so guilty when I realize I don't feel anxiety (So far, meds only helped that for me. I'll talk about why I'm off meds for that later on this post - I got a tad off track and already wrote about that, then came back to this). Most, if not all, of my friends have a lot of similar mental illnesses as I do and I don't know how to help them wothout feeling as they usually are too. Many of my friends with depression and anxiety have always had the symptoms and have also been in treatment since childhood. For us, something as simple as a bit of a joking comment like ""you can't kill yourself before me!"" OR ""we are so fucked up. Lol!"" Can actually keep us going and bring us back to reality a bit....really bad days/suicidal ideation is all just a normal thing for us. We just need to be reminded to ""ride it out"" because it's going to happen, whether you want it to or not, and we know how they feel and have been in that same place many many times before and will be there again later. We're sick. Shit happens when you're sick. (I find it difficult to relate to some of my friends who are only now getting symptoms of mental illness in their 20s. It's just so new for them and society shames mental troubles so much that just knowing they have a mental illness will actually set off the symptoms sometimes. I'm 90% sure that's fairly typical for that...i just never felt like that, so I have 0 comprehension of it).  Anyway, this brain scan based treatment is ""experimental"" in the USA and therefore 100% payed out of pocket....health insurance is total BS sometimes... the cost is about $5k+ and I'd probably have to take out a personal loan or something to do it....just trying it to see how it goes is not really an option with this one. Should I look into it. Maybe see if I can talk with him about it and my feelings before committing?  PAST TREATMENT SUMMARY AND WHY IM OFF MEDS RN: Any meds I've been on merely locked up my depression and held its feelings inside of me, blocking my ability to let it out, leaving me miserable and even less emotionally aware than without (the aspergers naturally does this sometimes without locking my emotions up). My mother seems to think I felt ""relief"" with my functionally being up....not matter what I say, she assumes I feel worse off meds than on my old meds. She also has depression and anxiety and finds relief in being able to do daily tasks. On the rare days I can be productive, I am proud of myself for that, but I still hurt inside....at least i can cry when I need to now or have a genuine smile or true emotional reaction and feeling now. I can feel things now. Feeling things is a relief at this point, even if it's ussually negative feelings. I've had meds actually do some good with my anxiety. I do feel relief from that with meds, but they end up not working as well within mere weeks of starting and feeling good while adgitating my depression, so I stop them (I've gotten them in impatient and ran into issues seeing/contacting the outpatient survises that have been set up for me upon release from the hospital, so I can't seem to get a doc to switch the med and the depression can get so bad on them that I'm safer, truly safer, completely off meds rather than contuing what I have).

With proper treatment it is possible to recover fully from many mental illnesses.  &gt; but why can't stable just be my only treatment goal?  It should be.  Whoever is telling you that ""happiness"" is your treatment goal is not a good clinician.  &gt;For us, something as simple as a bit of a joking comment like ""you can't kill yourself before me!"" OR ""we are so fucked up. Lol!"" Can actually keep us going and bring us back to reality a bit....really bad days/suicidal ideation is all just a normal thing for us.  You have made mental illness your identity, and as with any other large part of your identity, you fear losing it.  I think the first step for you is realizing that you are not your disorders.  So I notice in your past treatment summary, all you do is talk about medications.  The problems you are describing are best treated with therapy and other such interventions. What kinds of cognitive and behavioral practices have you implemented to try and improve your situation?  I would urge you to remember that since you have experienced mental illness all your life, that also means you are accustomed to those maladaptive ways of thinking, and a pill probably won't be able to change your entire mode of being.    Your fear of recovering is actually normal and common. Google search information about the ""sick role"" and how oftentimes the longer someone is unwell, the more comfortable they get with being taken care of and having few if any responsibilities and as such they lose interest in the value of purpose.  &gt; On the rare days I can be productive, I am proud of myself for that, but I still hurt inside  Yes.  It does.  Even for people who are well it's not fun or pleasant to do things we don't want to do.  It seems like you are waiting for some day when all of a sudden you will be super happy and want to work.  That day will not come.  You have to practice doing things you don't want to do *every day*.  It is the repetition and breaking of old habits that will help you find intrinsic pleasure in responsibility.  Personally I would not encourage you to try a radical untested treatment until you put some serious effort into making cognitive and behavioral changes and see how that goes.

117,MentalHealthSupport,Advice/Question/Emotional Rant,Raven_Helena_Black,3,"Thank you for your reply. I am glad to know that this fear of recovery is not abnormal. I did forget to mention the therapies I've done, didn't I? I have done ""talk it out"" style therapy from age 10 and it was (mostly) counterproductive for me...same with many of my DMH provided programs. I was mostly yelled at for not always knowing a cause to my emotions, sometimes they reprimanded me for have symptoms at all. I have had a couple of therapists that I clicked with but they would end up getting new jobs and having to leave (I was happy for them but sad for me. But that's life.) or we could no longer afford the copays for the therapists and I would have to go else where. I've actually now been more able to see what sets off my symptoms and what coping skills work for me (usually music and walks help me). Most of my workers would not really listen to me if it wasn't things they wanted me to do or feel. Most of my issue with services was all while I was still a minor, so I had no legal say in changing them. My parents, the ones with that legal say, were just as bad at listening to what I actually felt I was capable of trying on my own and what I truly felt I needed help with. My mother is still like that to the point I really should cut her out. Her MS has fucked up her brain so much now on top of her depression and anxiety that we always fight. Despite treatment frustrations in the past, she has always been my rock....now her MS meds were taken away from her for a few months a short time back and her mental symptoms skyrocketed quickly - many of them are anger and losing her understanding of social cues (insurance dropped it and it took months to get the prior authorisation to go through). [My father dies when I was 20, making my treatment easier and finding self-value easier. He was a good man, not really a great father thanks to his parents being shit to him growing up.] Anyway, I say some of that because my mother is the one assuming I am on the correct meds because I do not outwardly appear symptomatic even though I'm am telling her they do not work properly  - what I meant by the last thing from my post you specifically commented on dealing with functionality, sorry if I worked it poorly (assumption correct therapy as well...though for now meds are the bigger concern. I want to try alternative therapies like ""expressive arts therapy"" and some memory recovery type therapies).  I don't understand what you mean when you say ""mental illness is not incurable""? I agree that treatment can be EXTREMELY effective, however a cure generally means the treatment is only needed on a temporary amount of time in order to completely destroy it from the body. If it was something like a growth on the brain that could be removed causing symptoms, I understand saying ""curable""....sorry, mostly not understanding do to the meaning of the term ""cure""...  I am glad to hear that doctors should not push ""happy"" versus ""stable"" on me. I've only had one doctor not get angry at me for my own needs and feelings that I felt 100% comfortable with. She was the only one to agree with my feelings on that. Unfortunately she only does impatient treatment currently (I asked before I was released back in May of this year).   I have,  unfortunately, lived with thinking of mental illness as a part of my identity. It's not healthy to be that way, thus me asking if I should look at this new treatment at all. I actually didn't think it was ""typical"" to fear really helpful treament. From what I know of this specific treatment course, it isn't ""radical"" per say, it mostly adds that extra neurological view with the scans to traditional treatment plans. It seems to be accepted that the brain will react differently to different things, generally in a consistent way for different disorders from patient to patient, and that can be made visible in MRIs and CAT scans. He is also trying to rule out any growths that many doctors don't consider looking for without any physical symptoms such as vomiting, dizziness, seizures, etc.   Actually. I think I will call him and at least inquire. You actually helped me out a bit, though not really in the exact way you suggested. Getting all of this out in writing helped organize my thoughts on this subject a bit better. Talking to a person rather than a notebook (I've tried journaling to get thoughts out b4 lol) tends to ground me a bit with my scattered and fear-driven thoughts. Thank you. ^_^ Sorry if some of this response sounds angrier than I may have intended btw. It wasn't meant to sound angry at all. I have more trouble with social cues and reading emotional intent in text form the verbal. Asperger's makes it hard enough in person sometimes lol. (Actually, the autism spectrum piece of my symptoms makes me quite curious to see a scan of my brain since there is a known neurological component to how I think anyway.) ^_^ Thanks again!

I have divorced parents. 2 step siblings and 3 half siblings. Raised in church. Type 1 diabetic since I was 7. I was super involved in school and activities and a great child and teenager.  I graduated high school and started dating a guy who was much more advanced than me. We went to the same Christian college and I lost my virginity to him the following summer. As soon as I lost my virginity he pretty much said screw you and I found out he had been lying to me about a lot of stuff and cheating. After we broke up I didn’t think anyone would want to date me because of being so innocent when I was younger and that being the first man I had been with.  It’s my sophomore year of college and about 6 months later and I start dating this 26 year old marine who i later found out was an alcoholic who had bad ptsd from Iraq. We dated for almost 2 years and he was mentally, physically, and emotionally abusive. And yes I’m an idiot for staying with him but I also didn’t think I would ever find anyone again after everything I had been through that would be with me. And when he wasn’t drunk and abusive we got along and had great ups. But we had terrible downs. Towards the end of our relationship I had a miscarriage and was completely distraught and didn’t handle the loss well at all. I laid in bed and despised him for not wanting the baby in the first place.  He left for the military and we ended things.   I went into a deep depression and lost about 25 pounds and started anxiety and depression medicine after ending up in the hospital with panic attacks.   About 6 months later I met my current boyfriend he is 9 months younger than me and he is different than anyone I’ve ever known. He’s soooooo stubborn and very strong headed. But he was there for me when I needed him the most and he’s always good about calming me down and loving me for my crazy self.   But the problem is that I take my anger out on him soooooo much. I don’t handle life well and I will start yelling and cussing at him like crazy. I never ever ever dreamed I would be like this. I know it’s not healthy and I know it’s not right. But it just comes out and I don’t know how to stop it. I will get in his face and lose my anger and just want to hurt him ( I never have and never would ) but it’s the urge that scares me. I’m usually a sweet caring and loving person. I don’t know what is wrong with me...   Has anyone experienced this after traumatic life events or after going through abusive relationships?

145,MentalHealthSupport,Mental Disorder?,Ontanium,1,"Really hard to post this:  Ok, this is going to tarnish me big time if anyone I know reads it. However I need some input on my in most furtive thoughts.  I am 26 now and have believed that ever since I was in college (around 20) that there is some kind of a conspiracy around me to get me killed.  When I say conspiracy, I mean like people believe me some sort of child molester, or something as bad (which I would deem worthy of death btw).  So I want to list things I have done, that I dislike about myself along with the reasons.  Here:  • Viewed (inbred) Simpsons pornography -- This was shown to me when I was younger by a close member of my family, my brother, and has stuck with me for a while.  *I'd like to add that I am over it now, and actually view no pornography at all. In that time I may have viewed other questionable pornography (which I don't remember) but in any case I do not now.  ** Sorry for the incrimination  • Attacked a friends dog  I thought they were trying to kill me and the dog was a fear factor that upset me. ** My thoughts after turned to yet more conspiracy.  I witnessed my friends Sister poking the dog with a stick while he was caged and seemingly (to my eye) enjoying the act. Couple this fact with the fact that they got him from an abusive home and I started to think that it was all on purpose. My friend also witnessed how my father responded to a dog being hit in the park noting to me that my dad was very angry at that -- basically this is where it gets a bit ridiculous, when I start to think that it was planned intricately so as to cut of member of my own family -- if my dad knew that I'd attacked an innocent creature (a dog especially) he would care too much what was going to happen to me  ** This is the main one that makes me think that people genuinely want me dead. I genuinely feel bad about this one, and will hang my head for the rest of my days (I believe legs being broken is more appropriate).  • Put my friends hand on my genitalia  Not proud of it and I don't know why I did it -- Although I do blame someone a little for putting things in my head my actions remain my own. Wish I hadn't • Sexual fantasies of the snake from Jungle Book  This has been in my head since I was a child, and was quite a bad one for me to get over. I actually blame my dad for this one, although I'm not going to go into why. The MOST despicable thing for which I almost took my life, had it not been for my brother.  • Almost forced myself on my Sister. At the age of fifteen, my sister would have been seven or eight -- After I stopped myself, we frolicked outside running around the caravans until that too went south and we smacked into each other at speed (blind corner). I or my mom took her inside, nose bleeding, while I went off to a cliff to hang my head in absolute shame.  I don't know why this happened. But thank God that I did not go through with it. These are all things I wish I had the money to talk to a psychologist about. But I will have to settle for other peoples opinions.

I have one more semester left to graduate which will probably be fall of this year since I don’t have enough money to take all the classes I have left in the summer. Anyways I’m worried about my financial aid not being renewed for next school year since I failed a class last semester. My gpa is still high but I’m worried it won’t be renewed for next school year. Also I don’t know what I want to major in college. I feel so stuck where I live. I live in a tiny apartment one room with my dad on top of a mom and pop shop in a really bad neighborhood. There’s no windows in this apartment. I run into people wherever I go. Whether it be a gas station, street light or at the mall I always run into people that I know. I’m paranoid. I’m currently working at a retail store but they’re only giving me about four hours a week. Also I feel like no one there likes me and that’s why they’re giving me such little hours. I keep feeling like they think I’m slow or something .  On top of that in order to apply to other jobs I need references and I’ve only held about two jobs where I don’t know if anyone there has anything nice to say about me since I was always a nice worker but had a lot of absences in those high school jobs.

183,MentalHealthSupport,25F - Coping with brothers suicide and my own mental health,help-and-advice,1,"**LONG POST**   So I'm posting as I'm looking for any advice or help and basically just to get things off my chest.  I'll start off with my own mental health first... I have suffered with body dysmorphia for 12 years and bulimia for 3 years (currently recovering). I finally went and got help in May 2017. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. I completely broke down at the doctors but I finally spoke out and admitted I needed help. I plucked up the courage to get help by posting on here (a different account) first. Anyway... I started attending therapy and by the end of June 2017 I'd stopped making myself sick and carried on going to therapy and focused on the body dysmorphia side of things and tried to change my thinking about myself. I found therapy SO helpful and I learnt so many things about myself and tools on how to tackle the demons in my head.  Anyway... weeks went by and then unexpectedly my brother (only 23 years old) commited suicide in September 2017. I obviously had to take a break from therapy but it triggered my old eating habits. I stopped eating, lost a stone and when I got my appetite back I started being sick again. I've managed to get that under control again but I feel absolutely disgusting about my body and how I look again. I feel like I'm back at square one. As I went on a therapy break, my therapist went on long term sick and still is... and I've been offered a new lady who seems lovely... but I'm not sure how I feel about seeing someone that I don't know or have built a relationship with. Also I'm scared she will want to talk about my brothers death and I'm not sure how I feel about that...  As for my brother... it was the worst, most heart breaking day of my life. I'd had some time off work due to a surgery earlier in the year and I was due to start work on the Monday morning. I got to the training base (4 hours away from home)... and got the phone call from my Mum to say that my brother had killed himself. Luckily my boyfriend came straight out of work and drove me 4 hours home so I didn't have to drive or be alone. We had no idea that my brother felt suicidal and he never left us a note or any clues as to why he did it. His ex girlfriend had broken up with him 2 weeks before however I don't blame her for his death.   I just can't cope with everything right now. I feel so down about everything. I have the most amazing family, boyfriend and I love my job... but I just feel so low. I feel like guilty and like I'm being ungrateful that I feel this way but I can't help it.

183,MentalHealthSupport,25F - Coping with brothers suicide and my own mental health,Aravoid0,2,"Hey there.  I think it's a great thing that you decided to post here and especially that you searched for professional help for your mental health. It really sounds like a lot to process, and you'll need all the help you can get.  Losing your brother at such a young age is one of the most horrible things I can imagine. Having a brother of similar age myself I don't even want to think about what it would be like. I don't really know what the reasons were for your brother, but I think it doesn't matter.  Please take lots of time to recover, going through something like this while also having other mental health problems is extremely rough, something that a lot of others might not understand. It sounds like you're close with your family and boyfriend, so don't hesitate to talk to them about this and get through this nightmare together. You're not ungrateful at all, you're doing everything you can and deserve to get the help and love from other people.  The pain will never go away completely, but if you take your time to process the entire thing and work on it, it will eventually help you to get to terms with it emotionally and hopefully find new peace and joy, even when you miss your brother a lot.  Anyway, stay strong, this is a very hard time for you, and I hope you'll be able to get through it. If you want to talk about it more, you can send me a message.

261,MentalHealthSupport,My autistic brother,zimzimzimzimzim,2,"Hey there. You put a lot into this comment, and there wasn't a specific question or even really any punctuation, so I'm inclined to assume you're a troll. But in case you're not:  I'm not an expert, no one on this sub is. If you're having negative feelings, try to find an adult you trust to talk to about them. Ideally it would be your parents, and I encourage you to tell them how you feel. If you can't get through to them, try a school counselor, teacher, religious leader, or another family member.

276,MentalHealthSupport,Need some inspiration.,emmamaryparker,1,"Hey team, okay so I live with my fiancee (Im gonna say right here, that this man, is my dude. This has been the most rewarding experience of my life falling for my best friend HOLY SHIT IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS) and I want to be with him.   So my background is my parents tried and loved us but mum shouldnt have had three kids, it was too much, cause she was severely mentally ill in a super rural community (where they just did not do talking let alone talking mental illness) in what people now refer to as 'The Forgotton Highway'. So a mixture of that/both parents having to work too much to have a relationship with us kids/divorced/a very highly strung child always seeking to be perfect, failing and being overly destroyed blah blah youngest of a then combined family totalling six kids: you end up with a individual diagnosed at 24 w anxiety,depression yadayada. But I am also like the best person when I am on form, I am so loving and so caring, my friend once said to me that he wished I gave myself a 1/4 of the love I give back into the world and to the people I care about and literally every animal. And that shook me. So I started sorting my shit out, taking my meds, not drinking, exercising regularly, having personal and professional goals, being hella creative and letting my natural warmth transform me into a a genuinely well meaning little gremlin,making my goddam bed every morning no matter if I got out of bed singing or crying (my dad died when I was 21, I miss him so very much and constantly have nightmares that I have upset him somehow or just dream of him and wake up and BOOM realisation he is gone hits me full force so I wake up scream/crying a lot :/).   Im at university now, starting at 26, studying in the medical field so I can be an EMT/mental health wellness carer in rural communities. Jesuhs sorry for the novel. What I'm explaining is that I have pushed an overflowing bucket of shit uphill in the past 4 years to become the start of the person I want to be. But we live in this house with my partners little by 4 years brother. And he is making it super hard for me to keep sane and keep my cool during the day and I find myself losing my shit (The worst I do is yell ""get me some food right now cause I don't want to say the mean things that are circling my head right now!"" my poor boyfriend) but I hate this feeling of anger and how overwhelming it can be, sometimes I just sit on the back lawn and cry (its got a valley with heaps of trees and birds so its a good place to cry) because I don't know how to help this guy sort his mental health issues that are dragging me down. HOW do I talk to someone who I feed and care after like a child (with the help of his mate who lives here too) but who wont take any notice of anything else besides his own life and now my boyfriend has to look after him now or he will go back on the streets. We don't have kids yet because we wanted to enjoy our twenties together and be passionate and mirthful and playful, thats what life is about we reckon! But I cant push any conversations with this kid or he will literally just stop talking and avoid you like the plague it makes the house so awkward to be in. How do I make him open his mind to the fact that everyone is just trying their best and he has to take responsibility for his own life so he can be a goddam astronaut if he wanted to he's literally that freaking smart and so his family can have the freedom to do what makes them happy. He smokes a LOT of weed, (so do I, but I am also getting a degree, am engaged, have travelled quite a bit, own a house, am considering buying another house, have two dogs, chickens and pigs for a meat supply and grow my own vege's so I feel ok with my usage, it does not deter my determination, in fact, I use it to boost myself.) I don't want it to cause problems between me and my love, but it has already and sometimes I get so mad at him because of his brother and I hate feeling that because its so unfair for him.

Honestly, if somebody were to film me going throughout my day, you’d likely think I had a normal or even “perfect” life. And you’d probably be really confused why anytime I’m alone, I break down. Honestly, I sometimes don’t think my negative feelings are all too valid either.   Ever since I can remember I’ve had social anxiety. I think it’s the worst it’s ever been. I don’t even know what to say about this because I’m a textbook example.   In the 4th grade my life changed. I witness domestic violence for the first time. Over the course of 4 years I witnessed my father abuse both my mom and my brother. Never me, but watching it, hearing it, and fearing it did a lot of harm on me psychologically. I actually didn’t even have friends over because I was so afraid they’d see it. But anytime I left Home I’d worry about what was happening with my family. I felt trapped but I told nobody because even though I didn’t like my dad, I loved him and I didn’t want anyone to hate him. But the abuse has stopped and now he’s the perfect dad if I could only forgive him.  Probably due to abuse trauma, my brother had a heroin addiction. He was violent too. There’s was holes punched in almost all walls and doors. I was “ the good child” expected to be the one who gave my parents a break. Eventually he was kicked out of the house for my safety, a new guilt of mine to carry. But whatever, he’s home again and just like my dad he’s better.  Lastly, I developed and eating disorder because of the narcissistic abusive best friends comments. Obviously she didn’t make me starve myself, I did that to myself. But I did lose 15 pounds when I was thin to begin with. Partly to be accepted by my friend, and partly to spite my mother who told me I better fix my eating disorder because her focus had to be on my brother. But after fainting and losing hair and failing a class, I recovered.  Honestly the theme of my life is that I’m supposed to be the good one. The bad things didn’t really happen to me. But, in a way they did. But I’m lonely because I’m always brushed off anytime I open up. So, because I’m so used to this, I just stopped opening up. Because I’m supposed to be fine.

405,MentalHealthSupport,I found out that my crush is a serial rapist.,throwaway109u,1,"M (20/21M) was first friends with my coworker, J (20M). Then, M and I (19F) had a class together. I already knew that he was into me, and I thought he was really attractive too. Then, he became my coworker.   For a while, M and I flirted a ton.  It’s important for you to know that I have an extensive history of abuse, mainly sexual. I am severely traumatized. My sexual development has been hindered, which means that I struggle to feel proper sexual attraction without wanting to cry and I also struggle to be physical with guys to the point where holding hands is too intense for me.   Then there was M who came along. The farthest I went with him was hugging him, but I was intensely attracted to him go the point where I would touch myself to him. That’s a big deal for me because typically, even the thought of another guy touching me cringe in terror and heartbreak, which is not really a turn on when you’re trying to masturbate.   Having a crush on M was a big deal for me. I was allowing myself to have fun with attraction in a way that I never have been able to before. I’m usually scared to have guys be flirty with me in the way M was, but when he would get close to me or touch me, it felt great. I started to have more faith in humanity, and I reckoned that even if I eventually reached the verdict that he wasn’t good to pursue further, he would at least have the consideration to not sexually assault me. I know that sounds extreme, but my default mindset is that every man is out to get me (I know that’s bad. I’m working on it.).   Fast forward a few weeks and we make plans to study, and he just doesn’t show up. When I asked him about it at work, he started talking about how he was busy with the company he owns, and that I should buy a pair of leggings that he is selling. In that moment I was like ok clearly this person has no respect for me, and so he is no longer worth my time, and I was so okay with that. In fact,  the whole experience was really restorative, because it allowed me to step back and realize that there’s definitely an in between. Not every guy is either going to protect me or hurt me. I was glad to have the experience of feeling sexy getting that attention and being sexually attracted to M, but I also felt great moving on as soon as I realized he didn’t have respect for me.   Then one day J told me that M doesn’t work at our job anymore. I knew that something bad had happened by the way that he said it. J and M lived together and had been close friends ever since they started college.  Then one night, J tells me that he fired M because 4 girls had gone up to him and said that M had raped them. There were other details that J was vague about that lead him to the conclusion that this definitely happened. J and I are very close and this is not something that he would lie about.   That was a few months ago.   Since then, I have been destroyed. Looking back, there’s an incident in which M said something very rapey towards me that could have been interpreted in two ways. At the time, I went with the explanation that it was just him being nervous around me, since that was the more rational explanation. My trauma can often lead me to be quite paranoid, so I’m often afraid of nothing. Now I look back and I’ll never forget what his voice sounded like. It was dark and twisted and sadistic, as if he wanted to do really bad things to me. I’ve also had another friend tell me about an incident in which M was very rapey towards one of her friends (he was lying on this girl’s bed trying to get her to sleep with him. He only left when the girl got her other friends to force him to leave).   For the remainder of last semester, I had to watch M flirt with other girls in our class, and they were putty in his hands. He did it right in front of me. They fell for it, just like I did, and just like so many girls have before. I was just another pawn, but he’s been a fucking catastrophic disaster in mine.   He’s now back in his home country facing charges, but at the same time, he’s never left, and I am ruined.   I am horrified at this truth, and I’m sorry if I get graphic here - I have never been so turned on by anyone in my life. He was the first boy that I’ve been so consistently sexually attracted to in that way, and I’ve rarely came that hard thinking about another person. And he is a serial rapist.  And of course my attraction for him is nonexistent now, but at one point, having him be my first was a possibility that I was excited about. And it sickens me to think of all of the times where I would fantasize about him doing those things to me. I never want to see his disgusting face again.  It took me so long to get to the point of being open to loving someone again. I would’ve been totally okay if he turned out to just be a fuckboy, but the fact that I so narrowly avoided raped is so terrifying to me.   Now, my trauma has gotten worse. A whole new dimension of hurt is present now. I thought I had trust issues before, man.  But here’s the thing. There’s this really cute boy who works in my dining hall. We are both very intensely attracted to each other. He’s tried to ask me out twice, but on both occasions, something has happened that has prevented him. I’ve spoken to him once, and I honestly don’t even know his name.   But I find myself thinking of this boy from the dining hall when I touch myself now. And the last time I was like that with a boy, he turned out to be a serial rapist, so my mind can’t help but say that what makes this boy different?  Problem is I’m so ruined mentally. I am so afraid that he is going to hurt me. I can’t stop hearing that phrase in my head—“he’s gonna hurt you.” That phrase has haunted me for years of my life, but it’s gotten back again ever since I found out about M. And I want to be brave and ask him out, but I’m so destroyed inside and I don’t think I could handle a relationship. I’m currently seeking professional help for these problems I have. I am very mentally ill. In the mean time I don’t know what to do. This boy is really good looking, and I’m so worried that he’s going to find another girl before I can even talk to him.   I’m sorry for getting graphic here. Please be gentle, especially when referring to me touching myself, as my history of sexual trauma makes it incredibly difficult to talk about this.

405,MentalHealthSupport,I found out that my crush is a serial rapist.,Cthula-Hoops,2,"You're paranoid. He's not going to hurt you. He would have already hurt you when he had you alone, most rapists are opportinistic. He's out of your life, you can move on but it really is all up to you. You probably don't want to hear this but you can't blame him, he's not going to kick your door down, please don't take this the wrong way.  You should see a therapist. Be honest about everything that goes through your head and be patient. It takes many sessions to learn a new person. Their suggestions as far as the cognitive work you need to do will be more personalized because they actually know you, but I promise they will say the same thing: You are overly fearful of extremely unlikely circumstances transpiring and you get nowhere feeling sorry for yourself. Don't be upset, therapy always stings. I swear it has to in order to work. Lol I won't get into my shit but my therapist said I needed to stop being a coward. It hurt my feelings and I got pissed but I took her advice eventually and now ignoring my unhelpful compulsions is like ignoring somebody elses public conversation to focus on what I'm doing. You're going to be okay.   My personal advice: Get a gun, learn how to operate it confidently and you'll feel much safer just having it around. A lot of women have at least one guy who scares them and that's okay, the world is fucked, you should be afraid. A lot of women are reluctant to get firearms so I assume you are, but you probably know at least one person who is into firearms. Ask them to help you pick out a handgun that works for you and take it to the range once a week until you are confident about operating it in the dark. It will probably never happen but guns are a huge turn off for rapists, it doesn't matter if they are twice your size. I obviously can't promise your saftey but if you follow though with therapy and know how to get the lead out, I promise you won't be afraid anymore.

406,MentalHealthSupport,Can’t sleep and haunted by imagery,throwaway109u,1,"I’m OBSESSED. My brain is driving me crazy tonight.   If you want the full story, check my last post, but in short, one of the last guys I was beginning to pursue trend it to be a serial rapist. And that broke my heart. And now there’s this new guy. And god I had trust issues before but I don’t even know this guy’s name and I’m already convinced he’s gonna hurt me.   He and I are both interested in each other, but I’m not ready to pursue someone right now, so I haven’t gone up to him.   But my brain is OBSESSED with him. And don’t get me wrong. Fantasizing about someone is fine from time to time, but I’m hoe salty so sick and tired of thinking bout him. I tried to go to bed at a decent hour (5 hours ago) and I haven’t been able to sleep. I can’t stop seeing his face in my brain and it’s so dumb because he’s literally just a guy that I think is cute and my brain is blowing it out of proportion. I’m not enjoying the process of having this image of him constantly in my mind. It’s invasive and certainly not enjoyable at this point. I just want to sleep.   I kept trying to sleep, and whenever I would begin to drift off and have a healthy mindset, I would either have to pee, get a really sharp pain in my body, or get a strong itch that wouldn’t go away after deep breathing, and I would just have to start all over again. I just want to sleep and escape this pain for a few hours. I’m scared to be off my phone right now because being in my own thoughts is terrifying.   Having a crush is supposed to be sweet and innocent and enjoyable. And sometimes when I see him it is, because we clearly both like each other and want to get to know each other. But now it feels so tainted.   I’ve scheduled the first appointment with my new therapist on monday (the last therapist wasn’t all that good), but right now it’s Friday, and I don’t know how I’m going to be ok until then.

408,MentalHealthSupport,I am lost,Jack_Burton_the_2nd,2,"Well you’re on the right path by recognizing you have something that you need to deal with.   First off bad thoughts happen to everyone. It’s normal and it’s okay. You’re allowed to have whatever thoughts you want.   What causes an issue is holding onto those thoughts until they change our mood and drive us into depression.   Cognitive diffusion is a great exercise to keep you from dwelling on those thoughts. There are several videos on YouTube explaining the exercise.   The main idea is to become present. To take yourself out of your mind and into the present moment. The best way for me to do this is through smell our touch. When I’m feeling overwhelmed I go outside and walk in the grass barefoot, while doing so I take deep breaths of the fresh air. If you can’t do that, take a piece of ice and hold it in your hand until it melts. Focus on the ice melting, do this as many times as you have to in order to take your mind off of your intrusive thoughts.   Also try to not diagnose yourself or label yourself. Often times this leads to shaming yourself which turns into a whole other set of problems.   You do need to talk to those around you. Try talking to your mother as calmly as possible. If you don’t think that will work try writing her a letter and have her respond with a letter. It’s easier to not get caught up in the moment and respond with anger if you’re writing it out.   Talk with your teachers, principals, school councilor. You don’t have to be dramatic. Just explain to them that you recognize that you’re not okay and that you want support. I’m certain they will help.   I want to say that I am not a professional mental health provider. I am just a guy that has dealt with depression, ptsd, ocd, suicidal thoughts and all that goes with those things for the majority of my life and I want to help other people like me.

411,MentalHealthSupport,Hi - i need help with my life.,Rag77567,1,"Hello. I need advice and help. So... here is my story.   I have the most emotional psychology ever.  I am an INFP ( the idealist) , I am Empathatic, I am right brain dominate, and I was born on June 22nd which means I am classified as a cancer.   I have good self awareness and I constantly evolve and learn new things. I can continue to endlessly get wisdom. That's my strength.   My problem is, I want to get married and have kids and be independent. I am a man (male) so society really does not like me I guess.   I am too emotional and not really logical. I have trouble learning knowledge in college and training schools. But if I try (taste) an experience, it leaves a permanent true understanding of how it is in my mind.   So I live on social security because I have been classified as having a mental illness. I see a psychiatrist and I am stuck at 4$ an hour checks and I can't drive.   Being an INFP / Empath / Cancerian ♋ - I feel very useless and stuck. I can't live the happy experiences that would help me be happy and fulfilled on the mental emotional spiritual level.   If I was a different birth sign or if I had a different personality I would be able to hold a job and be independent.   I am just too emotional and useless as a man. I have strong morals and ethics as well as I believe in righteousness and honor....but other than that I can't really get out of my rut life situation.   I am useless in are society. I don't know how to find independence and a good love life as well as extra money in are society. I can't drive or cook and I am 30 years old.   I don't have a mental illness or learning disability ..well maybe I do ...but I do not think logically  or intellectually. I think emotionally and morally. That is how my brain works.   So that's my story. As a human I got all emotional personality traits.   I guess I am just never going to have a good life. But it's fine. Thanks for hearing me out.

424,MentalHealthSupport,Is it normal to loose sleep over potential social situations?,EmotionalDrag,1,"I'm not really sure what I'm trying to accomplish by posting this, but I want to get better or at least learn how to accept myself and cope with what can't be fixed or changed. I'm not trying to seek a diagnosis at all but I'm not with how to get help for this and I'm losing the patience to try.  My whole life I've been very introverted to the point I was relatively asocial in elementary school, until I was about 10 and got a good friend I'll call Megan. She was my best friend but when it came time go to middle school she got accepted to this school well off smart kids go, and I went to a normal, public school. The first year of middle school went well, but one day it was like something snapped in head and suddenly I thought she'd do better without me and I ghosted her. She tried for the next two years of trying to connect with me but I was too embarrassed and couldn't explain why I stopped talking to her, so 8 ghosted her. On the last day of 8th grade, she sent me a message on yahoo messenger and said that since the last two years had come and gone without me, she was done.  This sort of thing has been an ongoing problem since then. I'll be 26 next month, and I'm really worried because it keeps happening in my life. Suddenly, without a logical or explainable reason, I just stop talking to people. I struggled with people pretending to be my friend just to invite me to a birthday party and bully me the entire time and that sort of stuff when I was younger, so I'm afraid to get too close to people.   Recently, a friend(Jason) invited me to go hiking with him and someone I had a falling out with, who is down with this but I'm not. I'm not sure if we were actually in a relationship, but he told everyone else but me that he wanted to break up. Then proceeded to start slowly ignoring me, but there's reasons for that and they make sense. I don't want to anything to do with his mother. If I never saw his mother again, it would be fine by me.  Jason wants me to go with them into the woods and go hiking. The forecast is for rain, and Jason said we'd leave if it rained... Then said that the forecast says rain. Something doesn't feel right about it.  I tried asking about the guy who I had a falling out with, and Jason didn't answer the question. Past experience is telling me this is a trap. But I'm not sure that's the case. I absolutely do not feel comfortable with this at all, and I'm worried that it's because of a personality disorder to be completely honest. I think I've got agoriphobic tendencies, if not a full blown anxiety problem like OCD. I was diagnosed with GAD and clinical depression when I was 12.  My last therapist thought I thrived around people, but honestly I don't. I prefer to be alone. If someone is going down an isle in the grocery store I need, but it's not busy and no one else is there, I'll wait for them to leave before I go get my stuff on the off chance I need to say excuse me because I have a problem with my voice where I'm either speaking at maybe 5 deciples tops or yelling, have struggled with a speech impediment my whole life.  At what point does dreading, avoiding socialization, and losing sleep over social invitations become more than just a problem? This affects my ability to maintain a job, it's impacting my ability to enjoy life. I'm not sure what to do, but I don't want to cry myself to sleep because I haven't gotten a chance to cuddle with anyone in about 5 years.  What can I do about this?

I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, depression, ptsd, anxiety and insomnia. I’m 17.",gatorly,2,"As a psychology major who has the same diagnosis, here is my take.   These are called intrusive thoughts. An intrusive thought is something, usually traumatic or irrational, that you know is morally wrong, but you continue to think this way. They are difficult to stop from happening.   They could be coming about for multiple reasons. The most probable is that you are lacking so much sleep that it is disrupting the part of your brain that controls impulses and rationalization.   Second to that, you may be experiencing a bout of psychosis. As someone with BPD who was diagnosed at about 15, but am now 33, I really hated hearing that at first and it still irks me. ""Psychosis"" does NOT mean ""psychopathic"". It means you have thoughts that are disturbing and irrational.  Third, if you ever experienced some sort of abuse, which most people with BPD have, your PTSD, lack of sleep, and tendency toward psychotic episodes are all lending themselves to these homicidal thoughts.  They can be somewhat helped with cognitive or dialectical behavioral therapy. I would highly suggest bringing this up to your therapist.  If you ever have the urge to ACT on these thoughts, you definitely need to mention this to your therapist.   I'm sorry you are dealing with this. Through therapy, you can get better and relieve a lot of the symptoms that come along with your diagnoses. I promise. I am basically an older version of you. ❤ There is hope, and you can work past this and be very successful and happy! You need to choose to do the work, though.

I recently asked my mom to put me into therapy, which was really hard, because I'm bad at asking for help. I was really embarrassed of the way I've been feeling, and I really hate talking about it, but I realized I had to because it was just getting worse. First I talked to my sister because we're closer than my mom and i. I was worried she would think I was crazy because of the way I've been feeling, but she listened to what I had to say, and then helped me tell my mom.

480,MentalHealthSupport,Worried about friend - unsure next steps,PartyJournalist,1,"Hi everyone,   I am worried about one of my close friends whose life has taken a sudden turn mental health wise and what to do.   I have been friends with this guy, Matt, for about 8 years. I knew a bit about his past (abusive family) and that he struggled with mental health, but he didn't greatly talk about it. He has been in and out of therapy for the past 3 years, and was diagnosed with cyclothymia about 2 years ago, but was too scared to get on medication - so talk therapy and the coping they taught him were what he was working with.   This has led to a blow up and he broke down, I was there to support him through it, but now he has cut me off. During his break down he broke up with his long term girlfriend of almost 6 years, who he was utterly in love with. From what I knew of their relationship it was happy and healthy, and his ex loved him dearly, as he did her. The end of their relationship was sudden, and he said himself he didn't think about it before it happened - something switched and he decided it was over. He essentially just cut her off and stopped talking to her - she tried to fight for him, but essentially was too drained after weeks and so has left him alone. He told me at the time he was breaking up with her because he wanted to work on this mental health journey alone and focus on himself, which I respected, and from a brief conversation I had with his ex she does too. I do not think she is aware of what is happening now as he doesn't want her to find out and hurt her.   Matt started going to a professional about the week after the break up, and got diagnosed officially with bipolar, ptsd, anxiety, and depression. He was started on medications for these, a friend of his (Maisie) also just got out of a 1.5 year relationship, and had a bad childhood. Matt moved out of his home (a week following his breakdown and break up) which he shared with our good friend, and into Maisie's house 'to keep each other accountable to go to therapy'. They then about a week or so later embarked on a romantic relationship, and adopted a dog together! All through this he was not really talking to his other friends, but would talk to me a little bit as I was making a lot of effort.   I called him out on the weirdness and rashness of the situation, even if he is falling for Maisie, it seems to intense to move in together and co-own a dog after dating for a few weeks (right!?). Especially as he ended his relationship because he needed to work on himself. I don’t think he had feelings for Maisie prior to this. He was always very practical, and didn't want to rush into things, but he is convinced this is the girl he will marry now.  He was very much in love with his ex, and I don't doubt that he was, but he is now claiming he never loved her or felt for her at all, yet at the same time he got upset with me for accidentally playing a song she likes because he can't deal with it! He thinks that everything he is doing is good because he thinks now he is on medication everything is fine and he is healthy enough to embark on a relationship, but it seems too fresh to be so serious!   I am concerned about him, and that he is ignoring his issues, and that this will all blow up in his face. I can't imagine such serious and prolonged mental health issues can be solved in a week, and that he can be in a healthy relationship already with such high commitment.   He is now cutting me, and pretty much all his friends off, and only hanging out with Maisie. I am unsure what to do to stop it, and help him see sense! He is going to therapist, and I obviously don't know what is discussed there, but surely they cannot condone this? Am I being crazy? Should I just let him get on with it?

Our brains just work a little differently than most! Also, I think group therapy for you is a great idea!  As for not wanting to do anything, I'd start small. Take things in small chunks and give yourself little rewards for doing things! When I was in high school, I had to move to an alternative school to deal with my inability to go to class.

But if you go all week, maybe get some ice cream or something.   I find that if I struggle to get out of bed, if I do small chores like showering, cleaning off my nightstand, etc., it can make me feel better about my progress, and sometimes motivate me to go to work anyways.

539,MentalHealthSupport,Am I depressed,tomserrentski,2,"Hey bro.  You may be depressed, but as silly as it sounds, you shouldn't worry about it too much. It's important to accept how you feel and try work out the reasons why you are feeling that way.  Sometimes there are no obvious reasons, and in other circumstances they are blatant. Not finding the answer out immediately shouldn't discourage you... remember, the brain is just another part of your body, much like your leg or arm.  If you broke your arm or damaged your leg you wouldn't have a problem identifying that and accepting you're in pain. No different with the mind, stuff goes wrong sometimes with our bodies and eventually your leg won't be broken anymore. It will heal, but you can't walk on your broken leg, you need to rest it, take care of it and look after it.  I get that cannabis may help in the short term, but probably won't help you in the long run. Think about cutting down, for sure. It's important  to not feel too scared, literally millions of people (including me) suffer with depression and I can literally guarantee it will get better and likely disappear completely, but don't just try and ride it out. You need to be pro-active to beat this shit.  Take some steps to help yourself out. Eat a little better, do some light exercise and most importantly stop worrying about being depressed. It won't change the fact that you are. Accept that you probably are depressed or at the very least not happy.   Now take a deep breath and work out how you are going to beat the Black Dog.

552,MentalHealthSupport,"Very long text, I'm sorry",canadian-men938,1,"First of all I'm 20/M and from canada. For not too long ago I lost a person in my life that was very important to me. First I thought I can handle the situation but started to get really depressive. After a time my mind brought a lot of things and mistakes I made in the past to me and made me chew on them. Each new ""thing"" took me like a week to fully process , so I can start thinking about something normal again and enjoy my day a bit. It didn't last long, after a few days the next thing from my past would come up to my thoughts and start plague me. If I wanted to think about anything else I really needed to concentrate. I couldnt  smile once and cried alot that time. But things got worse. After I was done with ""a couple of them"", my mind would go further and make me believe things that aren't true. Or I believed arent true. For example, that I leaked nude pics of myself to a stranger online... I know Ive chatted with a couple of strangers but would never do that on porpuse, so my brain made me believe the weirdest way how it happened.. But thats one of the more harmless storys. I even felt responsible for the death of another person who died in a car accident!!  The way I leaked the pics ,is so unrealistic and kinda dumb and really not my way. But because its so long ago, I can never be a 100% sure I didnt do it if you know what I mean. So I think thats what my brain wants me to feel. Insecure. Even when it sounds so dumb and stupid, my mind repeats the story over and over again so that I start thinking its the truth. because it's just impossible to prove wrong. The only thing I have is my memory, but when I try so hard to remember the truth I want to hear , I can think about nothing else. All of this never bothered me, all of this happened long time ago and I had a normal life after that and never any problems. Didnt even realize these things as ""Problems"".  Maybe its all true and I'm just realizing the small devastating Details now? Anyway I could never change anything about it, the only way I could be sure, is if anything catches up with me. So the best would be just continue living.  But I'm very scared of that because I couldnt handle to be responsible for another persons death.  I dont know what to do anymore I hope anyone of you can help me in anyway. I just want my old life back. I just want this all to stop. Everytime my mind repeats the storys it gets a little worse for me. Its so hard to stop it, I've tried so much. I'm feeling like everybody hates me since I'm so depressed and not doing anything then being for myself. it took me alot to even write this down and make this public.

552,MentalHealthSupport,"Very long text, I'm sorry",keenxturtle,2,"You might have post-traumatic stress. Not the disorder, just the stress.  When you think of things that have happened to you more than, say, six months ago, do you have a strong negative emotional reaction? If you do, you need to talk about them to someone. The first time you'll bawl your eyes out, and the second and the third, but maybe by the fifth time it's not so hard to talk about, and by the tenth you're just talking about it with no strong emotional reaction. That's the best and probably only way to deal with post traumatic stress: talk about it till talking about it doesn't hurt anymore.  Same with your friend. Talk about it with someone you can trust. When they notice you're taking blame upon yourself, acknowledge it verbally, restate what you said, and keep going till it doesn't bring on a strong negative reaction. This might be hard to do now since it happened recently, but you should still try to talk it out with someone.  Weather or not it's post traumatic stress, your serotonin system is definitely out of whack. The best way to describe this is using lobsters, because they have a serotonin system like us. When a lobster is challenged to a fight, it gets pumped up with serotonin. This makes it stand up tall and posture with it's claws out, ready to fight. The lobster who loses has a sharp decline in serotonin. It becomes submissive, crouched over, and timid. It lost, so being aggressive can get it killed, and its little lobster brain knows that and acts to protect the lobster.  Your brain doesn't know, really, that your friend died in a way you couldn't have prevented, that had nothing to do with you. It thinks ""a valued member of the group died and so I must keep my body safe"" and your serotonin plunges. It makes you anxious, scared, and alert to danger. It looks for possible signs of danger and makes you think about them, then observes your reaction. If it makes you upset, it must be a threat, so it will reinforce your negative emotional reaction by making you more anxious and more afraid. That's why the only real way past it is to talk about it and talk about it until you don't have an emotional response. Your brain can then file the event away as ""not dangerous"" and let you move forward with a little more serotonin than you had before.   You need to talk to another person, regardless. I hope you will consider some counseling, but a good friend will do just fine. Another person will stop you and say ""hey, you're being too hard on yourself"" or ""don't you think that's unreasonable?"" or ""maybe if you think about it this way...""   When we spend too much time in our own heads, it can lead to a bottomless downward spiral. You need outside information and feedback to help you separate what's true from what your mind has inaccurately rationalized as true.   If you'd like, you can PM me. I don't know if any of this is true for you, but I'm really familiar with emotional stress responses and I could probably help you sort out how to move forward.  And you can move forward. You have the potential. You just need to learn how to get out of your own way so you can reach it, and part of that must be allowing a second party to listen and help you rationalize.

Its annoying but it's getting a little better. I dont want to ruin the things that were fun for me, for example when I get my medication for my physical diseases I get nausea.

569,MentalHealthSupport,depressed for no reason,greenflyingfeather,1,"I am 21. My depression is worse in the morning. I feel like there is no meaninful reason to live. I don't want to get up. Then I force myself out of bed. I don't want to eat but I eat anyway. When I start eating, I get hungry and eat very fast and eat many things (I am thin anyway so this is not a problem) My depression is looking at the world's beauty without being able to be part of it. I have friends but I don't see the point of seeing them. Feels like nothing makes a difference and want to abandon all of my projects. I spend my time staying outside or with my cat but when the depression is bad I just watch the simpsons or something like that and obsess on the internet about which mental illness makes me feel like this.  It's not so bad every day. Sometimes it leaves me as soon as I get out of bed. Some periods I don't even have it. I remember that my first period of depression was in middle school, during the summer, but it was because I didn't have close friends. Then in high shool it went away completely until during the third year of high school it came back. Anxiety started that year. I wasn't actually anxious, but I had chest pressure and diazepam helped it. I started smoking more weed because of depression (or maybe it was the other way around) and then I started abusing diazepam. I took all the 100mg bottle within 5 days. I talked in slow motion, fell asleep at random times, didn't care about anything (I was taking more than prescribed). One day I mixed it with weed and passed out and I decided not to take it anymore.  At the end of high school in 2017 (five years here in Italy) I tried several psychedelics. I was so amazed by those experiences that I didn't feel depressed anymore. Then at the end of summer I took mushrooms and I remember crying during that trip. I remember feeling dirty for the pain I had been giving to my parents (they knew I abused drugs). I felt relief while crying and things started getting better but I still felt this depression lingering despite the fact that my life was good. I wanted to take more psychedelics to realize the good in my life but since that mush trip it's like psychedelics turned on me. In 2018 took LSD twice having teerifying trips. In a desperate attempt to experience happiness again I took MDMA three days in a row and the days after I would have killed myself if I didn't know it was just the comedown. Then I discovered DMT which lasts for only 15 minutes and I had beautiful trips but when I came back to reality I still felt bad. At the end of the year another mushroom trip turned bad and after that trip things have started to go downhill. I had random moments of anxiety in which I lived the sensations of the trip until at the beginning of this year suffered from a mental breakdown (racing thoughts, heavy anxiety, feeling cold and shivering, sensivity to noises and lights, insomnia and sleep paralysis).  I recovered from it and I started feeling better. I thought that maybe it had been drugs' fault all the time. Started going out again, feeling like myself again, new activities, going at university again (before I did exams without going to lessons, as I'm doing now). Then randomly one morning I woke up feeling depressed. On that day I lost hope. Anxiety comes back when I get stressed (and I easily do).  When I felt good nothing was different from now (except for all the things I did in between ). I remember that in my childhood I had difficulties feeling part of groups and communicating to other kids. Felt better with my parents. I learnt how to read and write very young. Going to school when I was 5 has been traumatic and at school I had repetitive behaviors like walking in circles, hated to do works like filling shapes with paint and all the kids' stuff. Couldn't sleep far from home (this issue has come back since my mental breakdown). Had many nightmares at home since I startes going to school.

578,MentalHealthSupport,Let Me Introduce Myself,Anxiousone88,1," My name is, let's say, ""Caty"".  I'm a 31 year old, female, who has gone through the struggle of having anxiety and insomnia my entire life, even when I didn't know I had it.  Here in my ""later"" years, my anxiety has gotten a lot worse.  Probably starting in 2014 is when it started getting worse.  Then in 2017 and 2018, I hit a really high peak with it.  I finally put myself back in with a psychiatrist and a counselor, even though I wasn't so keen on that idea due to past experiences.   I've always had issues with Insomnia.  When I was a kid, my parents would get mad because I would constantly get out of bed saying that I couldn't sleep.  Well, of course they didn't believe me.  They just thought that I DIDN'T want to go to sleep.  I still deal with this as a 31 year old.  I've done better with medication adjustments (although, I was also pretty hesitant about taking medicines again as well).  But there are still times where I won't sleep at all, and this can be one night, or multiple nights.   Again, I've apparently always had issues with anxiety.  Looking back through old medical records, and speaking with my psychiatrist and counselor, I had anxiety as a child, and as a teenager.  It's just happened to get worse the older I've gotten.  So, back to reluctantly going to see a psychiatrist for medicines and a counselor.  Where I've had to take medications all of my life (one, due to ADHD/ADD, as well as my mother having me in and out of the doctor every chance.), I really didn't want to have to go through this again.  I knew they were going to want to put me on a bunch of medications that were just going to make one symptom or another (I also deal with depression as a result of the insomnia and anxiety).  As for the counselor, I've had so many experiences with those types of counselors that would ""yeah"" and ""uh-huh"" you to death, instead of actually listening.   Well, I finally found a psychiatrist and a counselor that are both amazing!  Just when I had given up on actually finding help for my issues, I finally found two women who are both amazing at what they do.  While I'm still on more medications that I'd like to be at this point in time, I'm also working along side my counselor with the goal of eventually being off of my medications completely, or at least being on as little as possible.  My counselor is the best counselor that I ever could have asked for.  She's so warm, caring, compassionate, and has really go tips and ideas that work for me.   So, now I'm doing great with both fields.  I'm content with my medicine regimen, and counseling is going great, along with my newfound love of meditation.  The things that I was obsessing and being anxious over, were finally settling down, and I was getting to a place where self-care could really be an important focus for me.  One of the things that I would constantly obsess over and worry about, even as a little kid, would be the death of my parents.  I would lay in bed at night, crying because I was afraid I'd wake up and my parents would be dead.  That was one of the things we had been working on in counseling, and I had finally gotten better about it.  During this time, while my anxiety was super bad, I had quit my job with a bank.  It was too stressful having to stress over life, and then stress over my stressful job.  However, I'm so thankful that I did quit when I did.  This gave me a couple of months with my Mom.  Unfortunately, she passed away much sooner than I had expected in April of this year.  If there's any type of major setback during counseling for anxiety, this would be one of those events, and it has been.   My heart is broken.  My Mother was my biggest fan, and she was so proud of how I was doing.  I had expected my Mother to pass away in the next few years, not this year.  Yes, I know, we really can't expect or plan for this but to a certain extent, even though I tried.  Now, I feel like have had a huge setback in my progress, which my counselor tells me is a perfectly normal feeling to have right now.  It's so difficult to imagine continuing on with my life without the person who gave birth to me.     What's even more difficult, is that, now it's just me and my, almost 74 year old, Dad.  As well as my boyfriend of almost a year, but that's another story for another time.  So, me and my Dad.  I was always so worried about both of my parents, but especially my Dad.  By the way, for those of you interested, he actually is my ex step-father.  Another story again, but me, him, and my Mother all still lived together until she passed, so now it's just us.  He's been my Dad since I was six months old.  I never had the opportunity to meet my biological Dad (even though I was able to get his ashes; another long story).  Anyway, my Dad had heart surgery in 2011, and that was so terrifying.  I thought I was going to lose him on the operating table.  The factors in this thought, were his age, and his health.  He's smoked almost his entire life, and drank most of mine and then some, even though he pretty much quit after his heart surgery; he has a couple of drinks now and then if we go out to dinner or something of the sort.   So, in the middle of making major progress with self-care, my anxiety, and my insomnia, we've now added back major stressors into my life.  I've lost my Mother at 30 (it happened right before my birthday, of all things), I'm worried about my Dad again due to this; big trigger.  I've also decided to apply for Disability while everything is going on due to being to anxious to even think about working, let alone, still mourning my Mom.   I'll be keeping this blog to help me through recovery.  I hope that anyone who might be reading my blogs, will be helped or inspired by them, and can find solace in the fact that they're not alone.  I want to help change the world, even if it's one person at a time, and I'm hoping that by giving myself a place to go to rant, vent, and just write, that I'll be able to help someone in the process.   I do ask that you keep any comments you may have in a positive manner.  Unnecessary criticism, or remarks are not welcome here.  This is a safe space, and I'd like to keep it that way.

How do I stop this?,woooooooooosshh,1,"I (19M idk if my age and sex would help in helping me but I’ll leave it just in case) went to a party last night hosted by my cousin for her sisters birthday. My cousin is the same age as me and only 4 months younger so she’s like pretty much my best friend. I recently moved about 11 hours away so don’t see her as much (actually on my way home now) anymore and that could be a reason I’m bummed out. Anyway she invited a bunch of her friends over, one of which got along and flirted with me the whole day (yesterday) She was just perfect honestly. She was funny, smart, beautiful, just a great person overall.   Now when I say she flirted with me, I mean she flirted HARD. They had a 60 foot tall water slide and their inground pool so most of our time was spent outside. Some examples of the flirting she did was, her bikini top “slipping off” on the water slide then winking at me when she realized I saw, hanging around me, insisting on sitting with me to tan on those outdoor little chair bed things (idk what they’re called) and most appalling, sitting on my lap while watching a movie when there was a seat right next to her.   Now don’t get me wrong I was totally fine with this, I was hoping this was going to happen. I assumed we would most likely hook up at the least or possibly keep in touch and work something out to be together because that’s the vibe she was throwing off.   I’m sorry for how long it is but here’s the part this post is about. When she was sitting on my lap like a face to face sit, she told me that she happened to be lesbian and didn’t have feelings for me. She then proceeded to fall asleep on my shoulder. I asked my Cousin who’s known her for a while if it was true and it was. I’ve been rejected before and it’s honestly never hit this hard, I’m just so distraught about it for some reason and I just don’t want to feel like this. I’m not the best looking guy but I play football for my HS (well did going to college next year so I’ll prolly play there) so I keep my body in good shape and care about it. Did she just like me because I was fit but remembered she liked girls halfway through?

Growing up I was bullied a lot. Since then I’ve developed a number of mental health issues. Crippling anxiety. Depression. Insomnia. I also can’t socialise at all.   I havnt had a conversation with anyone other than my long term GF and family for months. My group of friends moved away, distanced.   I try talking to people, but my mannerisms seem to make them uncomfortable. Forced eye contact. Sweating. Shaking.  Or I might not look at them at all, talk in hushed whispers and seem deflated.

There is a certain sound that triggers a very big reaction from me, and honestly, I've faced so much judgement from my family and friends for being afraid of this, telling me I'm overreacting or being dramatic. So I dont think sharing it here is gonna garner a different reaction, so I'll call the sound....the sound, I guess lol  This is a sound that becomes more common during the summer time, so during the colder months, I dont have to worry about the sound.

The sound isnt particularly loud but when I hear it up close I get really freaked out. But i dont exactly know how to categorize my freak out. Is it just that, a freak out? Or can it be considered a panic attack?   Also...do you know how I can get my family and friends to understand my fear? I have one friend, who has a fear of spiders, and I dont, so whenever she sees a spider, I take care of it for her, and vice versa.

735,MentalHealthSupport,Life tired,JCalamare,1,"Hello everyone! This is my first post on Reddit as i just made an account. I just need to be able to write my feelings down somewhere.   As the title says, i'm life tired. I have lost all ambition in life. I have no desire to live. I feel drained, and it's been like this for years. Let me explain why and how it possibly got to this point.  I never had a father or a stepfather. Let's start with that. My father died when i was very young and my mom never wanted any other men. Now, i need to state that she did a great job in raising me alone and i love her a lot. She did absolutely everything she could for me and still does. What affects me more is that i don't have a family either. I used to have a grandma who i was very close with, but she died when i was 10. I also had a half brother who also died before reaching 30. Most other family members are also dead and the ones still alive are not family to me because they just don't care about me or my mom and i feel like things or love should come from two sides and not one.   Let's talk about my youth. It was great, actually the best times of my life until i was 14. We lived abroad. My mom had a severe heart attack but luckily survived but we had to move back to my country for her health. There, i started getting bullied at school uptil i was 18, and then was forced to drop out. The bullying marked me for life. I stopped eating, got close to anorexia where at some point my weight was only 62KG for 1,85m height. I even got scared to leave the house and totally closed myself in. My mom was not happy either so that didn't help. It was a negative spiral. I have no brothers or sisters btw.   When i was 18, as i said, i dropped out of school and wasn't obligated to attend classes anymore. Me and my mom then decided to move back abroad, to the same place we lived before and were very happy. That turned out to be the right decision, because both of us improved health wise in general, i gained my first ever girlfriend, made friends, etc..   Now, i'm 25, and the positivity has dropped again. My mom is good so that's important. You probably see me writing a lot about my mom, can you tell she is my only family and extremely important to me? Sorry for that. If it weren't for my mom, i would probably have suicided myself. I often think about doing it when my mom will be gone, and i'll be all alone, with no family, no gf, nothing really. They say loneliness kills people. I can tell you that i believe such thing. I feel lonely a lot. I have friends, but they all have their lifes with their gf's/wifes and work. In the end, i am still alone, apart from my mom.   I live on the 10th floor in an appartment. You don't want to know the amount of times i'm standing on the terras looking down at the ground thinking ""why don't i just throw myself and end all the suffering?"" - Yup, not gonna happen as long as my mom is alive. She doesn't deserve that. She knows about how i feel and my thoughts tho.  Let's talk about love life. Not very succesfull. Not very serious either. Only one girl really loved me, altho that is what i thought. She lives in another region in the country, but i made the effort to travel and see her after talking to her for more then 1,5 years. When we met it was perfect and we were happy. Now, on the other hand, she doesn't even care about me any more, and i ask her, why do i deserve that, after all that time and effort i've put into her? No clear answer. We are not compatible, which is true, because she wants kids and i don't, but she doesn't want kids in the next 8 years, and who knows she could change her mind, so no reason to now block me off entirelly and even not caring to have me in her life anymore. I find it ungrateful, because as i said, after all the time and money invested in her. Note that we talked every single day for hours for 1,5 years and longer. It hurts, let me tell you.  About the country i live in; it's one of the worst countries of Europe economically wise. Salaries are very low, life (rent, electricity, etc) is expensive, huge youth unemployment. Sometimes i have a job, other times i do not. I'll never get rich until i win the lottery basically, and with rich i mean relatively simple things like being able to buy a house for example.   If you want to know why i just don't want to go back to my country, again, it's because i already did that, and we know how that worked out. I also barely know anyone anymore over there. My life is settled here, abroad, and i want to stay in this country, where i feel OK. Let's say it that way, OK.  Conclusion, all these setbacks and bad experiences marked me. Yes, i know everyone had and have these, but note that there is no hope for the future or change to be found anywhere. There is no potential. It looks like i will just be alone and feel lonely when my mom dies, and i'll just be forced to live a miserable life, alone, with a shit job with shit wages unless, well, i suicide. I prefer to suicide then to suffer day in day out my entire life. That's my opinion ofcourse. I am not sick, or crazy, just lonely, sad, unfortunate and sure, depressed maybe too. Pills won't help me. What would is a genuine good girl who loves me, so i am not alone for my entire life, or a lot of money so i can buy a house and travel, just like everyone. Nothing else will be enough for me to live a happy life, with a good mental health knowing that i will have as good as nobody once my mom is gone.

We got into an argument because he was upset over me being too short-tempered, so I confessed that I've been dealing with anger issues for a year now and depression for 3.  I've struggled with suicide, and until recently nothing had made me feel genuinely happy or proud of myself.  I felt for so long that I was a terrible person and my anger issues towards others stemmed from that.  I told him I'm working on getting better and that I have made steps in my relationship with my family, which was not doing well before and he understood that I'm working on changing and being less short-tempered with him.  He was the first and only person I've ever told, because I was afraid to talk about it.  He understood and said he was open to talk at any time.  He then told me that he hasn't been honest with me either, and then came out as bi.  Now, I have no problem with that.  I support him completely and while I'm straight so I can't understand what it's like, I can still offer my support and acceptance.  However, I feel upset at him because of the timing.  This was really important to me, and I feel like all of a sudden the conversation was about him and my problems that consumed my life for so long were dismissed.  If he had come out as part of its own conversation there would have been no problem, but he made it almost like a competition, like who has the most difficult problems.  I just wanted to talk to a friend about what's been such a huge difficulty in my life, and I feel like he made the conversation about him.  Am I in the wrong for feeling this way?  Am I just trying to put my problems above others and be the center of attention?

The loose plot was all I could make out because I couldn’t keep my eyes off of him and once it ended it was no mystery that I was in love with him. At least that’s what I thought...  I ran outside to the buses and gushed to someone who I assumed I could. She thought it was cute and pointed him out behind a pillar. I almost cried.

I choked on my words like I hadn’t drunk water or something. The feeling was foreign. I’ve never been this terrible around someone. I finally told him weakly that I liked how he was in the play and he quietly said thanks but I couldn’t hear it mostly because I was running for my dear life inside the school.

It started innocent daydreams and me writing about him being cute. It took a turn for the worse when my thoughts turned dark. I fantasized. I obsessed. For months I obsessed. I stalked of him. I ended up acquiring friends who knew him and who told me quite a bit of what I needed to know. I knew his age, grade, personality in a whole.   I soon found out why people didn’t like him but that never bothered me one bit as I continued to dig deeper. It got to the point where I knew his job and where he lived and his contact information. Things about him that was of no use. I talked about him too much. My journal was almost full and my drawing pad was full of him. Everything was him. I felt like i was going crazy for this guy but I don’t feel bad about it.   I texted him. I made a fake instagram account in order to talk to him but it went too far and I confessed it was me.

I’ve told my therapist this but she didn’t care much- probably expecting I was making things up. He seemed unfazed and it made me mad. I wanted him to be scared.

873,MentalHealthSupport,Need a few opinions,inpacevenio,1,"Recently, I was with my father in the car, coming back from a medical appointment. I was discussing a diet I wanted to put myself on and my boundaries for using a new skin medication. (I told him I would refuse to use it if it starts to irritate my skin.)  He eventually called me unappreciative and ungrateful for setting that boundary for myself against his will, and told me that I should just do what the doctor said to do—use the medication for two months. I have bad experiences with that shit, so I said I’d have preferred if he simply canceled the appointment, like I said to do, and let me figure it out on my own.   He said I’m not as smart as I think I am, etc., and instead of trying to figure shit out by myself, I should listen to people know more. I told him I want to just figure it out, alone, and he agreed. I pushed further and told him I’ve done it by myself my entire life—my way, figured out what I like and don’t like, how to do stuff, etc., and I’ve never had a problem. In fact, I said, the only one who ever has had a problem with it is you.   He nodded his head a bit, with his lips tucked in—I thought he agreed and was fine with what I’d just said. A few seconds later, though, he exploded:  He slammed the steering wheel. “You fucking rat.” His face went red. “I can’t believe you’re my fucking son. I can’t believe how fucking ungrateful you are.” He was screaming, the highest he’s ever raised his voice. “I can’t believe you’re my son. You’re the most unappreciative [person] I’ve ever fucking met.” I don’t remember much of that part, but every single goddamn sentence had “fucking” in it. He just blew up. “I can’t remember the last time you said ‘thank you’ to me.” This is despite the fact that I thank him for pretty much everything, which he shrugs off each time.  He kept slamming the wheel with every statement. “I think you’re insecure. I think you’re afraid of what people think of you. I think you’re a little afraid of failure, and that’s why you don’t do anything.”  “Stay out of my fucking way. I don’t want to be a part of your fucking life.”  I kept a straight face, but I was afraid for my life. An enraged man, at the wheel of a car you’re in, bashing you’re humanity with every word out of his fucking mouth. He’s always been this way. I say my opinion, I disagree with something he does and I express it, I don’t want to do things the way he wants me to—in any case, he scares me to the point of tears. He breaks me down and ruins whatever progress I’d gained from trying to build confidence. I’m extremely anxious and people-pleasing, so I watch his reactions to what I say. I’m walking on eggshells around him, and he’s the one I’m always silent around.   He yelled on and on about how much stress he’s under, how I don’t get it, how I “don’t understand how the world works.” How I’ve “had it all handed to me.” He’s right about that, but how is that my fault?  Fortunately, the furthest he’ll come to physical abuse is grabbing my wrists and physically detaining me so he can yell in my face. He usually blocks and coerces me into submission with empty threats. I’m extremely grateful that I’ve grown up in a nice part of the world with nice things, and that I’ve been spoiled from a young age. But I’m tired of this shit. It’s ridiculous. “You’re so ungrateful, and that tells me how immature you really are.”  “Fine, what do you want me to do? Whatever it is, I’ll—“  “Act like a fucking adult! Mature a little!”  “I’m trying, I’m trying.”  “Bullshit, that’s bullshit!”  I’ve tried everything I know how to do:  If I stay silent and let him vent, he demands I say something—“Well? Do you have *anything* to say? After all that, you have nothing to say?”  If I calmly explain what I’m thinking, he gets pissed and yells “bullshit”, or whatever.   If I shout back, he starts to get physical and attempts to trap me or “get my attention.”  If I try to remove myself from the situation, he says, “Get back here. I’m not done talking to you... Who do you think you are?”  It’s a lose-lose situation he’s set me up for. Thankfully, he hasn’t assaulted me yet—but I can feel it coming sometimes. It’s like I have to keep waking on eggshells even after we’ve gotten into a fight, just to keep him from doing me physical harm. I’ve been scared for my life before. He’s always been like this—I have a memory I can’t quite place. I was little, and confused about some situation. He assumed I was trying to pull something, so he said, right in front of the whole family, “Do you think I’m retarded?” I didn’t know what “retarded” was, but I knew it was bad based on how he said it. So I said no.   So, after that, I want to know: Am I overreacting? Is it verbal abuse? I don’t have any idea—I legitimately need an outsider’s opinion. The way he treats me is horrible in my opinion and it feels awful, but I won’t rule out the idea that maybe he’s entirely right and I’m wrong. I’m oftentimes scared to the core by how he just explodes, no warning, like he did today. He just ... seems fine until he blows up. He is under quite a bit of stress, but that doesn’t seem like an excuse to me.",1.0,1.0,-0.9975,negative,anxious,,"['recently, i was with my father in the car, coming back from a medical

What you are describing is self-harm, the question is why you were doing it. You say it was to see the blood flow, which sounds like curiosity. However, you yourself used ""addiction"" in the title... When we are harmed, our bodies react by releasing ""happy"" chemicals to make us feel better in order to compensate for the pain (seritonin or dopamine - i might be mixing them up) and adrenalin. This is why many self-harm victims mention feeling a ""release"" while doing it. After a while, your brain starts to need that chemical release you receive from cutting (similarly to how drug addiction works). So even if you didn't consciously do it for that reason, it may play a part.  If there are professionals (or more experience people) who have anything against what I said, please tell me and I will correct it.

I’m not ever going to harm her but those stories you see on the news about Mums and people always ask the same questions “why would she take her child’s life with hers?” I get it because you love them so much you can’t leave them but at the same time you don’t want to be here.  I’d never act on it, I think I’ll always have a grip on this enough to never hurt anyone or maybe even myself but god when your at a low it’s hard to shake thoughts and images out of your head. I think what scared me the most is the other day my partner came home, his jobs just been made redundant and I found myself 8 hours later numb just not feeling anything, no hunger, no anger, not even sadness just nothing and I was like a zombie filling out all my death benefits and making sure everything was up to date, and that it all went to him and my child because all of a sudden that’s what was going to help them.

I sound crazy, I nearly want to apologise for venting, I’m all over the place.  It’s like a constant fight with myself.

For some context I just purchased a new car. To get to my friends college I had to drive through some not so nice parts of town, which is where this event took place. I was behind an older beat up suv at a stop light, when the light turned green he started driving but was going very slow, around 15 mph, he started slowing down completely and stopped in the middle of the road. He then got out of his car and started walking very quickly towards me, luckily I was far enough back that I had time to swerve into the other lane and go around him. Wayne was in the backseat and after we’d been driving for a minute or so he mentioned that the suv that we had gone around was coming up behind us really quickly, I looked in my rear view mirror and he was flying towards us at this point. We were on a 4 lane road and I was in the right hand lane, so I slammed on my breaks and turned into a neighborhood, he was in the left hand lane at that point and he pulled a u-turn in oncoming traffic to follow us into this neighborhood. At this point Garrett has completely frozen in place and I’m yelling for Wayne to call the police, during this chaos I made a mistake and turned into a dead end. He followed and turned his car sideways trying to block us in, he then got out of his car again and started running towards us. I swerved around him nearly hitting his open door and got out of there. I started flying through the neighborhood, running stop signs and dodging other cars to try and get away, the whole time he was on our ass following every move we made. I turned back onto a main road and he was still following us, I blew through 1 or 2 red lights to get away. At that point we had started driving towards the nearest police station to hopefully be saved. We lost him before we made it to the police station, none of us had gotten his license plate number unfortunately so we couldn’t give the 911 operator a full description of who was chasing us. Wayne filed the police report and still hasn’t heard anything back, I’ve been having the same nightmare every night since that day about him actually getting to us and killing my friends and I. I can barely sleep, I work around 30 - 45 minutes away and today I got stuck in traffic and had a panic attack because I didn’t have a way to get out.

He was the nicest to me and FREQUENTLY touched me not necessarily gayly but still more than any of the other campers. I was very nice to during the camp and I feel like I gave him special treatment. Although it was only for a week I felt like I was doing everything just to be around him no matter what, subconsciously and consciously. At the end of said camp he even questioned my sexuality and I said I was straight obviously. I have had thoughts like this before for boys who are younger than me when I was like 16-17 but it got really bad this year. I don’t know what to do.

I don’t know why I have them and I don’t really want them that’s for sure. And I’m for sure not going to tell my parents about this mess. I don’t want to tell you my life story but here goes.  I joined the BSA to get away from my family I hated my situation. I’ve also known I liked boys since I was young too but I could never admit it as I was too scared to.  As far back as I can remember my parents didn’t like each other so they got a divorce. Said parents are also complete assholes and also expect way to much from their son at just the age of 10. Tutoring music lessons chores work ethic unreasonable study times physical and verbal abuse. My stepmother has severe anger issues and has hit me in the past before because she had a superiority complex. Meanwhile my coward father won’t stand up to her and just lets her rule  everything. My mother on the other hand acts like a child even though she’s over the age of 40 she parties and comes home drunk and high on  several occasions and I have to take care of her.  Enough about my parents. Anyways, this goes on for about 8 years and the boy now turns into a man. Shocked by all of his new “reponsibilities” the man now recollects his life and decided what he should do with it from now on. I find a job at a summer camp before I go out onto college. It’s a Boy Scout summer camp. I enjoy working with the boys and girls there it’s really fun. However one boy is different and takes particular interest in the counselor (me) and starts touching me inappropriately and I should have told him to stop but I didnt because I thought it was harmless. Week goes by and there ya have it folks.   Also I forgot to mention that I went to an all boys military boarding school and have been in scouts for ten years and have had sexual experiencs in there as well. My life so far has been a pathetic mess and almost seems irrepearable. I’ve also been taken advantage of in many situations and forced to do things I didn’t want to do. I believe that all of these terrible and memorable experiences make me have these thoughts out of a sick power to control someone or even think about Doing it. I know it’s wrong and I do want help I just don’t know how I would deal with it in the real world without my family and friends knowing.

926,MentalHealthSupport,I’m 18 and I like a 14 year old boy,throwaway-1442,6,"I feel for you but you asked me why it was wrong. You already know it's wrong. That doesn't require further discussion.   As for counseling or therapy there may be funded programs you can access, you're an adult so your parents should not need to know the nature of your concerns.   You're also catching this early on, so that is good. And it could be a result of what you went though, I think that's entirely possible.   If you are apprehensive about seeking help at this time your only options are to not spend time with boys in the age range that you prefer.   I don't know the nature of your thoughts, whether it's a dominant sexual thought regarding younger boys or if it's an overall attraction to younger boys.   I've taken only 4 psychology classes so my understanding is that when it comes from trauma like you've mentioned then it can be that you're attracted to those of the age that you were when you were abused. And you may want to abuse them or there may just be a physical attraction. Or maybe there is both. But again, I'm not a professional so I don't know how to guide you here or what to ask to get a clearer picture.   The only other thing I can personally think of is that you go out with men your age who would be interested in you. See if anything sparks and see if you're honesty maturing late, reliving past trauma, sexually attached to said trauma or even genuinely attracted to younger boys.   Regardless, I think a professional is best to seek in this case.   I'm not trying to attack you or make you feel bad. You having these thoughts isn't in any way your fault, and it sounds like you've been through a lot. But you need to look into the help you can seek in your country/state/town etc. There has to be something out there somewhere.

I am not trying to ask for help but if I can have any advice I will take it I just want to spill out my thoughts in face value. I am sorry if there is something wrong with my grammar.  Since I was born I have been kept inside the house for almost everyday if I am not in school, I have always been picked up by my dad from and to school. I rarely go out of our home and I do I would always ask permission from my parents and I rarely get their approval since they always ask me who I will be with and where we are going and how we are going there and most of the time they ask for their cellphone or telephone numbers before they allow me to.  Every time that I get into trouble I would always find myself in a position where my parents are there to defend me they are really nice people they always want the best for me. Though, sometimes I think that it is getting a little out of hand. Every transaction that I make, they must know, so I rarely buy clothes because I think that it will cost them more money since my mother always insists that she would pay for anything I buy which makes me feel very cautious of everything I buy, which sometimes force me hide when I buy something because I do not want them to raise a 19 year old man that does not know how to live independently.  I dont know I just feel like I am a waste of their time and money since my dad is always busy and does not like me going outside the house and my mother would always want me to stay in their care, I dont know how I am going to explain everything there is just toomuch to say and I dont know how to explain myself since I do not have much friends and I always resist socializing and the last time I tried to open up to some friends they get annoyed and I dont want to disturb them but I do not know how to handle everything on my own and I always have a hard time telling everything to by parents because just like awhile ago I offended my mother by telling her that I feel like I am rotting away in our house and I am a 19 year old man that is always kept inside when I got in a trip with my friends I had to lie about certain details because I feel like they will over react and unallow me to go to the trip. I dont want to offend my parents but I also feel like what they are doing is also slowly killing me.

She told me that my father will pick me up every day so it wont be hard for me but before getting picked up I must take a train since we live far from my university.

I have issues with jealousy of the non-‘i think my SO is cheating on me’-type.  The biggest example right now is that I’m jealous of my girlfriend for being so great. She’s funny and likeable and weird and is going to a good college and is looking forward to her life and so on. On bad days, I get so jealous of those things that I can’t stand it!  It’s not even rational. I’m all of those things I listed too. I get jealous of her for having traits that she doesn’t even super have, that I have and like about me!  One if the worst things is that I can’t stand the idea of being jealous of her. It feels like I’m losing, and I hate it!  Besides her, I get too jealous of children. I’m 18 (young) and I get too jealous of how young children are to be comfortable around them. As I am now, I can’t have kids.   There are a bunch of other examples, but I don’t need to bore you.

Diagnosed seriously so long ago and have been (relatively) stable on the meds so long, that I’ve created a wonderful life. The whole married, house and kids thing. (I’m still crazy but everyone around me loves me, and I’m lucky like that) I work in finance/ banking, and met a woman recently who literally broke down at my desk when I asked about her grown children.  Her son was a graduate and living at home still because of a mental break a couple years prior, after college. He was diagnosed with quite a few things (I won’t name here, for anonymity). But she just broke. She told me everything, and how hard it was for her, and how she didn’t know how to give him the encouragement he needed to know he could live life anyways.  At first, I was being professional (I gave her a hug) and I just listened, but she kept going on and on about how she loved her son and saw so much potential in him, but the PEOPLE AT THE HOSPITAL TOLD HIM HE WOULD NEVER WORK OR LIVE A NORMAL LIFE! This infuriated me, and 10 seconds later he walks in. Seemingly normal young man, asked me for some coffee, and told his mom he was gonna head back to the car. I’m even madder now at the doctors.  So I end up closing my office door, and I told her quietly I had a mental illness, and I have a successful career, a family, because I decided not to let it define me. It’s like cancer, you didn’t choose it, and as long as you take your medicine and see your doctor, it can’t take your life. She bawled more,  Her son apparently had been recently put on the right medication, and was eager to start working again. I asked what he majored in- turns out it was the same major as my brother.  We talked more, and I told her she rocked as a mama because she tried to understand her sons Illness and help him instead of shaming him.   Long story short: I contacted my brother and asked if he needed any help where he was. They need help. Connected the two, and he will hopefully start working in his field soon. God is pretty good at connecting people.  Also, I can’t believe a doctor could be so dense.  We are people too. Mental illness sucks. I have good and bad days and all that in between.  But we are more than just the organ that isn’t working. And we are super capable to achieving great things.   If your great thing is you woke up this morning, and showered, that’s fucking awesome.

He gets that I don’t like to be as social as him, he likes to go out and have a good time, but it’s too exhausting for me.  Even when we have people over, I make sure everything is clean beforehand, and I help prepare food, socialize for a little while, then retreat to our room. He gets it. It’s a lot for me, but I don’t deprive him of the social interaction he likes because I’m not like that.   Communication is key. Simply saying “hey, I get mentally and emotionally exhausted being in a large social interaction. I don’t like to do it for long, but I’m willing to go with you.” Figure out a way that can work for y’all.  If there is a party, and you know he is gonna wanna stay longer than you will, take separate cars. If it’s something you really know you don’t wanna attend, let him know you’d rather stay home.   We’re married, and really invested. So it’s easier now than it used to be. But I still told him it was okay to go out without me when we were dating. I trust him, he just wanted to have his version of fun. I enjoy watching Netflix on the couch. He joins me for that too.

954,MentalHealthSupport,Panic! At the concert,you_are_marvelous,4,"There's three that I know of.   1. Breathe in at a count of three through your nose. Hold your breath for three seconds and then exhale through your mouth for a count of 3. Repeat. This is what most paramedics tell people to do and it's called circular breathing.  2. The one that I do that works for me is to breathe in at a count of 5 through your nose. DO NOT hold you breath and then exhale at a count of 5 through your mouth. You don't have to do it at a count of 5. The important thing is to try and match your breathing count on your inhale and exhale and breathe in and out SLOWLY.  3. The last one is alternate nostril breathing (aka Yoga breathing):  https://youtu.be/MCK1jBfRVsE  To practice mindfulness, you ground yourself in the present moment to let your body and brain know there is nothing to be scared of--That there is nothing to panic about.  When we start to panic, what's happening is our amygdala (the fight, flight, or freeze part of our brain) is getting triggered and it's telling you ""Hey, there's an emergency here! You're not safe!"" and because your brain can't tell that it's not life or death (like a gun to your head) your amygdala starts firing rapidly and causes you to panic. The goal of mindfulness and/or focusing on your breath is to tell your brain that everything is okay. It will then send a signal to your amygdala to chill out and there's nothing wrong.  So to calm your amygdala down and redirect your brain to a calm space, you focus on your breathing or do mindfulness or both. To practice mindfulness, you focus (and tell yourself) what's actually going on around you.  Let's say you're at the concert and you feel panic coming on, you can start to try one of the breathing techniques. Then you start focusing on what is actually going on and what's happening to your body. So you'd tell yourself ""I'm at a concert. It's loud and I find that upsetting, but I AM SAFE. My feet are on the ground. Can you feel your feet on the ground? Can you wiggle your toes? What can you smell? Maybe cigarettes, someone's perfume?"" Again you say ""I can smell the perfume of the woman next to me. I am safe. It's okay."" Then you focus on your body. Maybe you feel sweaty or a breeze. You focus on your arms and legs and feel the weight of them while telling yourself ""I'm alive. I'm safe. I'm standing right here on the concrete."" Then you put your hands on your heart and tell yourself ""See, my heart is beating. I'm okay. I'm safe."" You can also press your hands together or clench them in a fist and then release them, all the while focusing on the reality and physicality of your body. You feel your hands press together and really notice the palms and fingers touching. Or you clench your fists and and feel them tighten and then release them and shake them out. Again, telling yourself that you're okay and you're safe.  Just concentrate on grounding your body into the present moment, focus on your breathing and telling your brain that you're safe. That should redirect any impulses that are going to your amygdala and calm you down.

Now that that's put of the way let me explain what's going on.  I have chronic depressive episodes, and they really started to go away near the beggining of the summer as I was leaving school, but they're back now. A few weeks ago, for the first time in about a month, I had a bad one, I wanted to just lay in bed all day and do nothing, so that's what i did until it was over. I've been getting them more frequently, so around like 2-3 times a week, and everytime I do I feel more and more alone. I will just randomly want to cry, but I never will, it's like I cant at all. Every day that passes I feel more and more lonely, which ends up leading to me having an existential crisis, which leads to a depressive episode. I have no idea whats causing it. I'm 13, and I have plenty of friends, so I shouldn't be worried, but i still am. Maybe its cause I dont let anyone get close to me and I dont share anything with anyone, maybe it's because I somehow feel the need to have a girlfriend, I have no clue though. I dont like letting people know about my issues as I dont want them to worry or pitty me. I dont really like people(no offense to anyone that knows me) and I've never really ""like liked"" anyone, plus I dont trust people no matter how trustworthy they seem. Idk, I just constantly feel like just laying down and crying. I want to cry just while writing this, but no tears will actually form, I cant cry. Sometimes I feel like I'm faking all of my depression and anxiety for attention, but that just makes me want to keep it more and more to myself, I feel like if I tell people they'll just think I'm faking it all. I hide under a facade that I created that makes me look like some witty, happy, and funny guy, but in reality all I want to do is just isolate myself and be away from everyone. I use the internet and video games as a place to vent and escape from my mind and everything going on. I'll often just lay in my bed at life thinking if it's worth it to keep going, or if I should just go and down every pill bottle we have in the house. Is it worth living when you'll be forgotten 2 years after you die, is it worth living if you feel completely alone all the time? Idk what to even do anymore, I hide behind jokes and humor constantly. My mom, dad, closest friends, and even my therapist dont know about my mental state right now, and honestly, I want to keep it that way. Im what people would call a pessimistic masochist, I see the down side of everything, and I enjoy getting hurt(not in *that* way), I like fighting as long as the other person fights back, I enjoy the pain and feeling getting punched in the face gives me. I honestly question whether i can even be hurt mentally anymore, or if I'm just a broken person. Anyways, back to what i was saying before. I feel extremely lonely, I feel like no one will ever love me, and I feel like the compliments that people give me are purely out of pitty for me. When I say love I also dont mean it in the lovey-dovey way, I guess I kind of do, but I mainly just mean it like family best friend kind of way. I'm sorry for the confusing formatting, but I just wrote down whatever came to my mind, and because of that I'm also sorry for all of the jumping around.

BPD is a complex disorder and most of the behaviours are not intentional (sometimes the person isn't even aware of their manipulative behaviour), and you are likely to be blamed when things go wrong because ""this wouldn't have happened if you had/hadn't done X...""  Set clear boundaries of what you will and won't do, and stick to them. One of these could be refusing to take responsibility for the consequences of his actions.  And don't take it to heart if he accuses you of anything, unless it's something you actually should take responsibility for.  It might help to do some research on BPD (reputable sites, not opinion pieces) for more information on what it is and how it affects the person. Keep in mind that while you're doing stuff for him, you'll be the best thing since sliced bread, but the first time you can't meet his needs (real or perceived), you can reasonably expect to be considered a traitor who has betrayed him. It's called the saviour-traitor extreme, and there is no middle ground.  Therapy would help him with ALL of this, particularly adding the stages between the two relationship extremes, but since he won't accept help, it's going to remain an issue.

1003,MentalHealthSupport,Mood swings from random bits of information.,you_are_marvelous,2,"Well, I'm going to take a stab at it and say that you have mixed feelings and anxiety because you've been raised to think of weed as a bad thing and it's been demonized. So there's already a stigma there for you when it comes to the drug. Then there's the other side of it, which is you tried it, you had a severe panic attack (which can happen depending on the type of weed. I've had one as well with some kinds, and not with others. And I've had depersonalization on weed too. Your frame of mind also plays a huge part. But weed can make you paranoid and then you can freak out, FYI).  So I'm guessing you feel like others around you can drink and smoke weed and be fine, and you can't, so you feel defective or like there's something wrong with you--but there isn't actually anything wrong with you, or them. People's bodies and brains handle drugs and alcohol differently. Think of happy drunks, sad drunks, and angry drunks. We all handle substances differently.   This might be a kind of lame example, but I can't eat eggs (like chicken eggs). I have a severe reaction to them and it's very painful and I can't ever eat them and I LOVE eggs. I watch my friends and family eat eggs--deviled, scrambled, fried...etc and they're doing just fine. But I don't look at them and get angry. My body is the way that it is. It has an allergic reaction to eggs. That doesn't mean my body is wrong or malfunctioning and their body is right and okay. It just means we're different. My husband is deathly allergic to bananas. I can eat them no problem. Is he any less normal? Nope.   Sure, I miss eggs and he misses bananas. But we just live with the fact that our bodies don't like them.  For right now, whatever weed you're smoking amplifies your panic and depersonalization. All that's telling you is that right now, at this moment in time, you can't smoke weed, and that's okay. Maybe in time, with a different type of weed, and if you address your issues of depersonalization and your ideas surrounding weed (it being demonized) you might not feel that way over time.   But I wouldn't beat yourself up about the fact that you have a bad reaction to it. I can't drink alcohol. Every time I do, my kidneys hurt. So I don't drink. I've been the one at parties that is the only sober one. You can feel kinda left out and like the lame-duck when everyone else seems to be having a blast and coping just fine. But try not to look at it like you're an outsider. Sometimes it's really fun and funny to be the observer of people when they're off their head and you're not.

I’ve always had these symptoms but they’ve never been extremely severe more like would pass in a day or two, was clearly able to graduate college and grad school, sustain a healthy loving marriage and begin raising my first child.   I was on Prozac for a few months but they stopped working 6 months in(despite upping dose) so with Doctors approval began cutting back (May possibly try for another pregnancy soon)  So it’s been about 3-4 weeks since my last reduced dose of Prozac and I’ve been feeling really down. I’ve never experienced these symptoms for soo long and without any improvements. I do not engage in self harm and am not suicidal. I don’t think I’m severe enough for inpatient or intensive outpatient but currently therapy doesn’t feel like it’s helping.

1045,MentalHealthSupport,Wasted years,Ethanj843,1,"So before I begin I want to thank everyone for reading this. I have put off writing this post or telling anyone the intimate details of my teenage years to spare them the emotional burden, which has just lead to my mental health declining more and more rapidly.   So a little backstory: I grew up in a very wealthy family, that appreciated money, but never boasted about it - did some quite luxurious activities, such as traveling to Europe/ Asia/ Africa once or twice a year every year, however they never spoiled me written. During my elementary school years I changed schools an insane number of times. Once halfway through first grade, at the end of first grade, after 3 weeks of second grade for my dads, at the end of second grade back to my hometown and original that I was in the first half of first grade, at the end of 3rd grade to try some wacky Montessori school 45mins away from my house, after 2 months of 4th grade to another Montessori school, at the end of 5th grade back to my original public school, which I had now spent Kindergarten, half of first grade, and third grade there, and finally switched halfway through fifth to a very expensive private school, which is where I would stay for until the beginning of 10th grade. Al these school changes never allowed me to easily develop a close group of friends and made me constantly feel stressed about going to school and finding a group I could connect with.   Jumping to the beginning of 6th grade, I had found my best friend, and became friends with his few friends at my new private school. This kid, let’s call him Tom, allowed me to feel safe and secure at my school, even if I didn’t get along the best with him at times. My friendship with Tom was very close, and I had develop a reliable, and relatively good group of friends come high school. I had always been the semi-odd, who was picked last in activities, as almost felt like the last resort, however not unusable. Apparently my mother sensed some sort of anguish during my time at that school and decided to take drastic measures. They signed me up for an exchange program with an origination that placed the students into host families. At the time this idea sounded awful, so I complained, but as time went on, and they had told me that I was already singled up, I grew accustomed with the idea - even cherishing the idea of pure freedom, with very little accountability for my actions (remember, I was 15), but as time progressed and the reality of my departure augmented, I became quickly hesitant and resistant towards my new life. I refused to speak to my host family on the phone, with the exception of simply acknowledging them once or twice on the phone prior to my arrival. Come departure time, my mother flew with me to the organization’s convention, she spent one night there and departed the following morning. After a day of icebreakers with fellow students, we departed for Paris, and this is where the most convoluted and distorted moments of my life occurred.   I met my host family at the train station in Paris, recognizing them through pictures I had seen previously. Trying to overcome my anxiety of the situation, I eagerly hugged them, with a big smile on my face. The car ride home was relatively quiet, with my host family refraining from making much of the standard small talk ( which they could have because I was fluent in French). I arrive at their house, which was quite large. I had my own room, and was happy with the living situations. I had a host brother, who was only 6 months younger than me (14), and had a good spirit about him. However, come the first day of school, things take a quick turn for the worse.   The school system sucked, my host mother signed me up for the local middle school on accident, thinking I was in 9th grade instead of 10th, since my host brother was in 9th, and French middle schools runs from 6th-9th. The kids on the bus were quite aggressive and loud. They would yell slogans such as “Ay, L’Americain!”, and other phrases to make me feel like an outsider. The school had a huge metal fence surrounding the perimeter, and the students used a book which granted them permission to enter and exit the premises. This book was called “Carnier” in French, and it had the students schedule, and disciplinary notes from the administrators. I did not fit in there, because the students very the forthcoming and blunt with their character, which caught me offguard. After some persuasion from my actual mother, I was switched into the proper school (high school), and was around kids my own age. However, things only to a turn for the worst, as the safety of that school environment was only worse. They still had ‘carniers’, with bouncers...oops I mean teachers at the doors allowing you in and out. The teachers frequently would not arrive to school resulting in the students having that class period off, the students would speak very loudly in class with very little regard for the teacher, and the teachers would retaliate by screaming back at the students to shut up, and if the students didn’t, they would simply stop teaching and threaten to leave the class. Turns, out I went to the second worse high school in all of France, what a surprise! The kids weren’t simply disrespectful, they were downright scary. They all had their own posies and would travel in groups. Although they weren’t actually that dangerous, my mind blew it out of proportion, constantly thinking that I was on the brink of getting jumped or robbed at any moments notice. This lead to a variety of physical symptoms, such as excessive sweating, an elevated heart rate, and a voice in my head constantly commanding safety concerns, such as “Don’t look! Smile! Ignore them! Look down! Etc.” My emotions turned into robotic actions, which made it a bit easier to bare the pain of being away from comfort. On top of all this, my house had a shitty TV, with 2 usable channels, and a WiFi connection - I say a WiFi connection because only 1 person could be on the WiFi at a time, and my host brother was constantly on it. This lead to me blankly staring at 4 white walls tuning everything out for hours and hours and hours, resulting in the days becoming a horrific blur, filled with emotional turmoil and repressed anger. There would literally be days in school we’re I wouldn’t say 1 word to a single person and maybe a grand total off 100 words at home. During my stay in France I contacted my friends and family from back home very infrequently, because I didn’t want them to be aware of the pain I was in, afraid of the fact that my remaining safety valances would be tampered. My 1 year commitment fell short in January, when my parents told me that I had to come and return to school in the US, otherwise I would have to repeat 10th grade. There was 1 catch - I switching schools again, but this time from a small 400 kid school to an insanely large public high school with 4000 kids.  The public school was truly huge. There were 3 separate buildings, with one end of the campus to the other end being a 10 minute walk. I would almost never walk by the same teacher/ student, twice in one day, unless they were in my class. I fell into a state of complete paranoia. I literally brought changes of shirts to school and deodorant due to the ridiculous amount of sweat I was emitting. I would stutter and my hands/ feet would shake regularly. I would walk down the hallways with so much tension and anxiety that I would become lightheaded, and sometimes saw black fuzzy pixel like objects in my vision. 10th grade was simply the worst year.  The start of 11th grade wasn’t better - it was sinking different. After the first couple months the fear and stress dwindled, however for the wrong reasons. I simply distanced myself from anything. I would find people I could bare and call my friends, and wouldn’t speak unless promoted to. The entire day was spent theorizing in my head of different possibilities ( I’m an INTP, so it’s easy to do). Towards the end of 11th grade I was tired of this submissive lifestyle and took a change. I began working out frequently, e.g. 6-7 days a week, 2-3 hours a day. I would use excessive weight, secretly hoping to gain acceptance from the people of the gym and bodybuilding became my lifestyle, and more importantly my identity. It gave me a reason to feel superior to others, since I spent my time more productively and was slightly stronger than them (even though I I honestly wasn’t). I would walk around with my last flared, with this ‘don’t fuck with me attitude’. This behavior lasted all through senior year and the beginning of my freshman year in college.  Towards the end of freshman year I began to self-reflect on my daily actions and have realized that I am still in a constant fight- or flight mode. The difference being that I am always on fight, compared to the previous flight in 10th grade. I really hate this new me. I am emotionless, and have not allowed myself to feel anything, even if it’s simply pleasurable. I saw food as a chore, leisurely time as a waste, and life as a bitch.   This brings me to today. I am about to start my second year of college, and want to change the trajectory of my college experience - afraid of a repeat from highschool. I’m reaching out to you reddit with the hopes that you have advice on how to form a new identity. An identity which isn’t operated out of fear, but rather excitement to explore what life has to offer me. I want to not be “an emotionless bitch”, as my sister has described me previously, and have something to be proud about.

1051,MentalHealthSupport,why are you so blue,bluepumpkinxl,1,"hello, im new here and to reddit too,i just typed mental health and this was the first to show in the results. Im still kinda nervous and undecided how am i going to express this shit that i dont understand inside me but here we go... I tried reaching  out to my friends, family and even to my partner, but i live in a family who believes that nothing could go wrong if u have a place to stay, clothes to wear, food to eat and university to attend, and if u still have problem with your life then you're just one ungrateful shit... and Im starting to think that maybe im an ungrateful one, It's really hard specially when deep down inside i know how much im grateful of everything that i have, the means to survive in this world, but i dont understand what the hell is wrong with me, Ive been fighting this since 2nd year HS and when i told my mom she just told me that its in just my head, i thought she was right, so i kept my self busy, joining every org, spending lots of time with friends and i must say yes it was a good experience but the feeling never go away it was always there, hiding in the shadows and taking over me when im alone. My hands would shake uncontrollably when it caught me, most times i would have to pinch my self or bury my nails in my palms so it would stop, for years i thought it would work just as long as i have ways to get rid of it when it comes to me... but those ways aren't working anymore and im in my 4th year college now.   It started to not work when i was in my 1st year college, my mom said i should study psychology, my first thought was they dont even believe in mental health, they call people who did suicide dramatic people and ungrateful of what they have. second, i wanted to study engineering or architecture, but she insisted, so i did, in the first term i felt every single inch of me sickening, i couldnt get up, i couldnt eat, most times i would catch my self daydreaming, but i stayed up till its late in the library so i could catch up with my lessons and not to disappoint my mom, it was good, 2nd term i told my mom psych is not working with me, i just cant get my focus, i cant finish a single task, even a simple house chore i can finish, its feels so hard to move or even just staying awake, i told my self that its just me being lazy that i can do it, of other can why cant I? it kinda worked then i got an offer in a known university in my country, i thought it would be a good chance since there is no tuition to pay and that maybe my mom would allow me to study a degree that i really want, but she never did allow me, yes i transffered but in the same degree and as a 2nd year college, it was good at first, new environment, new people, new university culture way more fun than the first, only that i have to travel 2-3 hours from home to school and another 2-3 hours from school to home every day, if im lucky and there is no traffic 1 an a half hour is a blessing.   i thought everything is going to be fine now, there is no reason for me to feel any shit, i got money, clothes, good university, a lover. wht else in God's blessing, but honest to goodness i still feel different.   so again i tried telling my family, they laughed at me for weeks, told me what kind of a trashy mindset i have and that maybe mom shoulve left in my dad because my dad is schizo and that maybe im like him. It really hurt me more when they told me those kind of stuffs, o felt useless and ungrateful and undeserving of the things they give me but i also felt alone, i thought family will always be the first one to be there when u fall and help u get up and understand me, but i feel like no one understands me, not even my own partner. My partner always gets mad at me when i try to open up or like cuts me when gets a hint that im about to open up or most times like change topic, if my partner doesnt get mad im lucky but mostly kinda shows disinterest on me when im down and just stayed with me and shows more love and care when i act jolly and happy.   i dont know how to deal with this anymore, i tried so many times to reach out to them, but i felt no one takes me seriously for years, its really getting hard to live with a heavy heart everyday, i may have mastered the art of faking smiles and laughs and hiding pain but these past few months i feel really weak and hopeless and alone.   I filed dismissal in my degree even though im incoming 4th year because i cant take it anymore and also i had so many back subjects and failed some because i cant finish essays and requirements in time, also since 2nd term in 2nd year i sleep like a dead, i dont know why, but no matter how long i sleep i just still feel tired and sleepy, i dont even  feel hungry, there was this time i sleep for almost 30 hours. but these days i sleep 12-13 hours. My family of course is really angry at me, they said that im hopeless and that they thought they raised me well but i only turn up into a mess like my father. i still live here in our house but they kind of make it to the point at me where ""do what you want in life we dont care but as soon as u finish ur study leave this house, we'll let you stay so there's nothing u can say anything about us""   these past few months ive been considering death, because maybe that way i wont have to be a burden to my  partner or my family. I feel horrible because maybe im such a bad kid to my mom or my fam, i try not to be, i wanted to make them proud, i wanted to do everything specially in terms of my academics to make them proud but im a failure. i feel unappreciative but at the same time alone because they kinda make me feel that im trying to make them feel bad because im like this or because im telling them im like this when the only reason i tell them that something is wrong with me because i still believe even just a little that they would understand me and help me. But i only ended up becoming an unpreciative person.   i feel that for the year that had passed i just got worse and that maybe i should end it because im hopeless.  my partner even told me that im

1054,MentalHealthSupport,Everyday life feels overwhelming,hpnerd2,2,"Good luck with grad school! I do the things where I don’t acknowledge my emotions and really feel them. I’ve learned it over the years. I’ve been trying to work on it though. So what I’m doing is journaling (not about everyday but about the things that caused me to emotionally detach). Of course, it is hard, but in order to heal from the past, it’s necessary to work through it. There’s also what I call an emotional wheel (I bet you can find it on google. It’s a picture of emotion words on a wheel). I struggle with what emotions I’m feeling and such so I look at the wheel everyday to see where I’m at. There’s also a free website that helps you work through similar things. It’s called inner pathways.org. I just started it.

1102,MentalHealthSupport,I have no idea how to deal with myself.,vlrose07,2,"I’ve been in this place and am here now. I don’t care if I live.... in fact almost all days I wish some random event would just take me away. I have people that care about me, but have isolated everyone besides my parents, brother and one friend, whom I still hide away from because I don’t want to keep disappointing &amp; worrying them.  Not meaning to intrude or make assumptions... obviously I don’t know your relationships with family, friends, etc. But I know there is at least one person that cares this way for you too.  Painful events/memories from your childhood have stuck with you and are negatively affecting your life and well being. Try to remember that your loved ones hurt for you too. They want the best for you even if they do not show it. Have you lost anyone extremely close to you, or even specifically to alcohol, substance abuse, bad decisions, suicide? Did this negatively effect you? Did you see the way it may have crushed other people? If something terrible were to happen to you, imagine how it would affect those people, your kids... will they grow up with a different form of unbearable pain the rest of their lives too?   My boyfriend passed from an accidental overdose 2 years ago. The depression isn’t just from the sadness of missing him or him being gone. Among a lot of other things, I am depressed about all of the negative ways and feelings I’ve had about life since then. The guilt. The memories. What else could I have done? It’s the things he took away from me...  he died when I was 25 years old and the pain of that loss instantly turned me in to someone who never wants to get married, never have kids. I have no direction in life because everything I imagined doing for the rest of my life was with him in it.  Please just think about how you may effect others lives and if you would be ok with hurting them intensely by you not being around anymore.    I think about this at times when I don’t want to live anymore. For most people I think about, I feel they’ll be fine and move on with life. But I will continue to chose life and to try to make it through solely for my parents.  They lost my older sister at 15yrs old in a car accident on the way to school over 40 years ago and they think about and miss her everyday so much it hurts. As much as I feel I can’t take struggling with life and mental illness and failing anymore, it would be against every moral and value I have to be responsible for causing them to relive that pain by taking another child (myself) away from them.   The only thing you can do to help anyone that you love more than yourself, is to help yourself.   This will take time maybe years, be kind to yourself, seek different therapies/treatments. Do your own research on personality and addiction and psychology. You will learn about yourself and will be able to pinpoint exactly what words or actions effected you and how they made you feel.. sometimes the only way of healing is bringing everything to the surface so it can change unrealistic thoughts, keep the past behind you, and help you move forward by making positive changes.

1119,MentalHealthSupport,I’m tired of being sick,you_are_marvelous,2,"Firstly, I just want to say I'm sorry about the job loss and that you're feeling so awful. It sounds like you're very overwhelmed (emotionally and with life) and just fatigued and burnt. Sounds like you've hit a wall, my friend.   I'm not going to sit here and invalidate your feelings and tell you that things aren't that bad or it could be worse, because fuck that. The reality is, things feel shitty to you right now and you have every right to feel whatever you want to feel. So that's something I really want to get across: You have every right to feel whatever you're feeling.   You do sound a bit lost as well and for that, I'm also sorry. It sucks to be in that frame of mind.   What I can tell you is that whatever is going on right now, it won't always be that way. Things change. That means there's potential for things to get better. It could have the potential to get worse, but let's just focus on trying to make it better because there's no point in going down the negative, destructive, non-productive rabbit hole of ""what-if"" horror show. That won't help anything.  For right now, I would be REALLY kind to yourself and tell yourself that it's okay to feel what you're feeling (scared, sad, overwhelmed, disappointed, lost, depressed...etc) AND that you won't abandon yourself--That you will do your best to be your own best friend through this.

1153,MentalHealthSupport,Hello reddit I'm going to tell you a sad story (bad grammar incomming),Sl0thyM0th,1,"Hi my name is Trevor and I'm bringing awareness to people who suffer from loved ones or friends over suicide. I'm going to keep family's hidden and the person's name as well, so here we go I'll start form my child hood. I was 6 or 7 and I was in the 3rd grade when I met him, he was an awesome person and really fun to play with during that time and we became friends but we had a falling out in the 4th grade for 5 to 6 years I think? And now its 9th grade and now I meet another kid who was in my U.S history class who introduced me to my now new family of friends. I bought an xbox to play with them and we did... alot and so during my sophomore year of high school I ran back into my friend form the 3rd grade and we catch up and my new friends take him into our group called ""the nerd herd"" so we play xbox with each other for months even years every single day. But my 3rd grade friend who was 16 at the time was dipping tobacco but none of my friends understood why but I did it was his way of copping with his depression. He was a sad kid but he never showed that side of him so my friends not really understanding him bashed him for it and wanted him to stop because it is unhealthy for him but one day he snapped and told us why he was doing it. I was concerned for him so I talk to him and I promised him that I'd never turn my back on him because I understood were he was comming from and that day he told me "" I'll always have your back your my brother "" and after that I was happy so eventually my friends let him dip in peace since it was his way of copping but what we didn't know was his depression was getting worse but he never told anyone how he felt. So the day comes my and my friends were playing xbox and our other friend joins our xbox party and tells us something that gave us all a reality check forever. He told us my 3rd grade friend shot him self and committed suicide. Everyone didn't believe him at first but he was dead serious and started to cry we all realized and started to cry and scream at everything in the world. But I was crying but couldn't move or really make a sound. Life gave me a lesson on taking my life as not a joke and others as well. So on that day I promised my deceased 3rd grade friend that we will all help others and each other no matter the situation. So I will end you on a happy note we did a anti suicide walk in a park to raise money for him and other victims, we also on his 1 year anniversary we spreaded some of his ashes on a tree in park next to a picnic table where we all use to hangout after school. But in conclusion I want to bring awareness to people who are suffering like my friend and help you or them to know it will get better and people care about them or you or at least I care.. alot.. thank you for reading my story.                                                                        -Trev",0.0,1.0,0.9902,positive,encouraging,,"[""hi my name is trevor and i'm bringing awareness to people who suffer from loved ones or friends over suicide."", ""i'm going to keep family's hidden and the person's name as well, so here we go i'll start form my child hood."", 'i was 6 or 7 and i was in the 3rd grade when i met him, he was an awesome person and really fun to play with during that time and we became friends but we had a falling out in the 4th grade for 5 to 6 years i think?', 'and now its 9th grade and now i meet another kid who was in my u.s history class who introduced me to my now new family of friends.', 'i bought an xbox to play with them and we did... alot and so during my sophomore year of high school i ran back into my friend form the 3rd grade and we catch up and my new friends take him into our group called ""the nerd herd"" so we play xbox with each other for months even years every single day.', 'but my 3rd grade friend who was 16 at the time was dipping tobacco but none of my friends understood why but i did it was his way of copping with his depression.', 'he was a sad kid but he never showed that side of him so my friends not really understanding him bashed him for it and wanted him to stop because it is unhealthy for him but one day he snapped and told us why he was doing it.', 'i was concerned for him so i talk to him and i promised him that i\'d never turn my back on him because i understood were he was comming from and that day he told me "" i\'ll always have your back your my brother "" and after that i was happy so eventually my friends let him dip in peace since it was his way of copping but what we didn\'t know was his depression was getting worse but he never told anyone how he felt.', 'so the day comes my and my friends were playing xbox and our other friend joins our xbox party and tells us something that gave us all a reality check forever.', 'he told us my 3rd grade friend shot him self and committed suicide.', ""everyone didn't believe him at first but he was dead serious and started to cry we all realized and started to cry and scream at everything in the world."", ""but i was crying but couldn't move or really make a sound."", 'life gave me a lesson on taking my life as not a joke and others as well.', 'so on that day i promised my deceased 3rd grade friend that we will all help others and each other no matter the situation.', 'so i will end you on a happy note we did a anti suicide walk in a park to raise money for him and other victims, we also on his 1 year anniversary we spreaded some of his ashes on a tree in park next to a picnic table where we all use to hangout after school.', 'but in conclusion i want to bring awareness to people who are suffering like my friend and help you or them to know it will get better and people care about them or you or at least i care.. alot.. thank you for reading my story.', '-trev']","[-0.25    0.2732  0.703   0.4767  0.8473 -0.6226 -0.597  -0.5673  0.8689

1158,MentalHealthSupport,Anxiety about parents,pm_me_furry_titty,2,"It takes a lot to take care of someone as they are going through Alzheimer's or dementia.  I used to work at a nursing home in the kitchen and would interact with the residents when going around to see what they want, delivering their requests, or just going around collecting plates/cleaning/etc in the various dining rooms.  Families put their loved ones into longer term care facilities due to the stress, anxiety, and pressure involved in taking care of them and seeing the path they go down.  &amp;#x200B;  Build yourself a support net for yourself, find friends and family that understand and will be supportive to you.  Whether its just listening to you vent or otherwise, its extremely important to take care of yourself before you try to take care of someone else.  It does no good for you or them to burn yourself out or break down, which is why its important to understand that your main focus should be your own mental care so you can help yourself, and them, the best you can.  &amp;#x200B;  I would suggest talking to them too about what their wishes are.  If they are wanting to, willing to, go to a long term care facility or nursing home then look into the various facilities around you with them.  Put in the time and effort to look before it gets to the point you are in a rush to find one so you can find one that meets your requirements.  See how happy the residents are there, check reviews, look into what kind of care they provide so you don't wind up with a nursing home that has too many things going wrong.  &amp;#x200B;  Some places are mismanaged, wasting funds inappropriately, some burn out their employees frequently (if you see one boasting that they have the high rate of new hires, that is a bad sign as it means people constantly are quitting requiring them to constantly hire and train new people that will just burn out soon), etc.  You have time right now to look, and you need to understand some have waiting lists that might take months to get an opening.  Make a list based on what places you visited that you and your parents feel are best to worst, ones they absolutely don't want to go to and ones you absolutely don't want to see them at.  Check up on them and the facility, again, the other residents happiness with the place is a good indicator of the facility.  &amp;#x200B;  If you want to try to care for them yourself as your mom has done, you NEED to be well equipped with the mental tools required to handle it.  See a professional therapist who will be able to teach you the skills and tools to help you through it beforehand, it'll ease your anxiety knowing what to expect and having at least a starting point or idea of how to handle situations.  &amp;#x200B;  Its okay to feel scared, its okay to feel the way you do.

1171,MentalHealthSupport,Need some help,Throwaway080813,1,"Hi Reddit, I'm currently having a life crisis and need somewhere to share my story. This post is difficult for me to type out, but I need to get this written down and can really use some advice/support. Please note that I have an appt to see a therapist on the 27th of this month but I'm really struggling as I have never shared this story to ANYONE and even thinking about sharing it with a Therapist is doing some major damage to my mental health.   So here it goes. Note - I am a 29yo male and my dad is still with my mom to this day.   When I was young 5-6ish my dad molested me on 3 occasions. The first two times he entered my room in the middle of the night and touched me inappropriately. At the time I wasn't aware that this is not normal and just thought ""he was examining me for something"" (like a doctor). Both times I woke up to him touching me and turned over and told him ""stop it I'm trying to sleep"" and he left the room. The final time is where I knew something was wrong. I was sleeping on the couch and woke up to him touching me again. I did the same thing as the last two times but this time he proceeded to put his hands on my butt and then stuck his head under the covers moving towards my groin. I instantly pushed back and was in the corner of the room terrified and confused. I watched him go into the laundry room next door and took this opportunity to run up and tell my mom. I proceeded to wake my mom up and explained to her what happened. She went to the basement with me to look for him and he was nowhere to be found. We then went to the garage and he was sitting at his workbench in only his underwear smoking a cigarette. This is where I lose memory of what happened, but my mom asked my dad some questions that I cannot recall. After that I remember that he was no longer in the house.  Everything I have written above I have come to a term with and understand that none of that was my fault and I honestly don't hold any resentment or anger about it.  This next part is what really haunts me, and I still don't know how to deal with it.  After I didn't see my dad for a while, I remember making some kind of statement to my mom along these lines ""Where is dad, why isn't he home? or ""When is dad going to be coming back home?' and I still don't remember what she told me. All I remember is that shortly after that he was back home, and no one said anything.  Still to this day I'm conflicted on how I should feel about this. Now that I know exactly what he did to me and the fact that my mom let him back in. I'm angry at myself for asking him to come back. But I'm even more upset with and conflicted on how I should feel towards my mom. I have trouble sleeping because the events just continue to replay in my head on repeat and the only thing that drowns the thought is alcohol or weed in copious amounts. I love my mom but every time I think about this I always question if I should love her and that's what hurts me the most. I have other issues because of this but don't want to go into detail to much but I'm not doing okay.  I've thought about asking my mom about this event but am afraid I will do some serious damage to her, my sister and myself.   My question - Should I ask her about the event or should I just keep this to myself and smile like everything is okay. Even though it's not.

Here is a quick summary of me and my health in the past - • Diagnosed with major depression in 2015 • Diagnosed with anxiety in 2015 • Diagnosed ADHD in 2016 • Born 1999 • Female • I take Equasym 40mg, Sertraline 200mg and Microgynon. Okay, so here is what I need advice on - In 2015, before any diagnosis’s, I was self harming, suicidal and had around 3 panic attacks a day. I also had a sort of ‘psychic’ sense of a girl watching me, who’s name was Elizabeth. I never saw Elizabeth, but I knew what she looked like and I knew she was there. She also had friends, Timothy and Minty - never saw these two either but knew what they looked like.  After a few months, and after taking Sertraline, they disappeared. But sometimes I can feel them... (I ignore it).  I also had two things I was afraid of - the ‘needle man’ (a large, black figure covered in needles) and garden gnomes. I have a phobia of needles but no idea where the gnomes came from. I would get scared for around 5 minutes and would have to ensure doors are closed and I’m under a duvet. This only seems to happen outside of my home. The last time I had this was around 7 months ago.  I have also seen a small, flying alien (the typical green alien) fly across my room for a split second. I also catch black shadows in the corner of my eye and get paranoid.  Recently I have seemed slightly more confused than usual. By this I mean I have questioned whether or not I have been in MY house, when it has definitely been it. I had to convince myself that nobody else would have photos of me. This lasted around 3 minutes.  I have random periods of paranoia. The main one is that someone will shoot me or a loved one through a window. This will last around 5 minutes, and I also get paranoid occasionally when curtains or blinds don’t cover entire windows (gaps where people can see in) and this usually leads to me falling asleep worried and checking my entire room for intruders.  I also have had sensations where I have felt like I’m floating (out of my body), my favourite songs sound slower than I remember and I feel rain drops on my skin whenever I’m outside or in the car.  Last thing is, when with others at home or at their house, I can hear them talking. I respond ‘What?’ as its always muffled, and they always say they didn’t speak.  What is going on?

The ""misunderstood intellectual"" who tries to be the moral compass of her friends yet borders of hypocritical and is also incapable of finding happiness. I too struggle to be happy yet try to help my friends despite some hypocrisy I wish I could distance myself from.  One scene from the show that stood out to me was the advice Diane received from the character Stafani Stilton who said ""*You know what your problem is? You hold everyone to an impossible standard, including yourself. It's super helpful for writing hot-take shakedowns and click-bate take-downs, but totally toxic for your personal life and internalized sense of self worth.

I realized that I hold myself, my friends, my girlfriend, my family and even my coworkers and strangers on the street to a standard that can never be satisfied. Because even if others and/or myself manage to improve, the bar simply gets lifted that much more.   I believe this comes from a fear of failure and the extreme outcomes that I've conditioned myself to believe comes from failure (financial instability, homelessness, etc).

I’m 18 and from the age of 12 I knew this girl through school who I’ve laughed and cried with. She was someone I’ve never fancied but I’d do anything for her.   We had our bad times and we went months where we didn’t talk. Then in January she found herself addicted to Xanax and she texted me asking me what happened between us and I was just as clueless as her with the situation but once we sorted that out I helped her get over this little addiction she had got herself into.   Then around April time I went to wish her Happy Birthday on Instagram after not speaking for a month and I noticed I couldn’t find her @. I then checked Facebook and then I realised she had removed me off everything.   I’m sorry for this shit story but it’s been since April that I’ve been left trying to think what I did wrong. In the 6 years I’ve known her, we have both gone down individual paths but always ended up becoming close again. Then all of a sudden I was blocked.   She told me her addiction started after being cheated on and then once she got off the xans, she got back with this guy. And then she became distant with me again.   My mates at the time would say she was using me whenever she felt shit and to this day I don’t believe that is right. I know it comes across that way but it’s not like her to leave me with no answers. Plus even though the majority of the time it was her needing my help/advise, I’d also find myself asking for her help too.  I guess what I’m asking is anyone else’s opinion on this situation. I find myself feeling abit lost, she would be someone I could tell anything and now I feel that I can’t express what’s on my mind unless I draw or write it out.   Like I mentioned before it’s been since April I’ve felt this way and certain days I feel like it’s eating away at me. I’ll be honest I have dreams where it’s her arguing with me or being really nice and I wake up and I don’t know what to think.

Also, is anyone else’s internal day/night clock messed up?",shayla_mk,1,"So you know how most people lose weight and get into shape during the summer months?   And most people say they have less energy and are more depressed in the winter months?  Well I don’t know why, but I’ve been the complete opposite my whole life.  I usually have less energy and motivation in the summer and I usually gain weight because there are typically no family events or anything going on and I don’t have friends to make plans with so I’m usually just at home doing nothing.  Well, when the winter months roll around for some reason I’m always happier and more motivated ironically, and I actually lose more weight in the winter.   I don’t know why this is, but I’ve always been like this.  Also, I was born in a winter month so maybe that has something to do with it?  And does anyone else get super anxious for the holidays because they have to be around family? I have a really broken family and every year I dread the holidays because it’s always so nerve-racking.   I know that sounds kinda counter active because I just said winter months are usually my better months.   But then again, at the same time, it’s just the holidays that aren’t the best for me.   Secondly, about the internal day/night clock.... every since I was little I’ve been a night person.   Like I’ve never had energy through the day and I feel soooo tired and sluggish and just not my best. But every day after about 5 or 6 PM, I have a blast of energy and I’m usually up all night until like 4 or 5 AM, and it’s usually when I’m most productive, is anyone else like this??   It can be a bit frustrating because everyone else is out and about during the day or always having plans, and are always so energetic... but I’ve just never been like that. I don’t know why.   And I’ve done everything to try and boost my energy; I’ve tried going to bed earlier and waking up earlier, drinking coffee, drinking lots of water, eating healthy, staying active, getting some sun, starting projects, taking cold showers, staying busy, etc.   But no matter what, I just don’t flourish during the day, only the night.   Does anyone else have these problems with their seasonal/internal clock?   I’ve read up a lot about it wondering what could be the cause, and a lot of things point towards the month you were born in, the time you were born, your zodiac sign, and many other strange things.

I enjoy it but it's tough so I study a lot at home in order to keep my grades up.I also work part time at a fast food restaurant and I'm currently in training to become a manager which is very exciting and would be great to have on my resume so I'm working very hard. Often 25-35 hour weeks. There are also a bunch of tests and things that I have to do at home in order to become a verified manager so my days are usually packed.  I'm also doing what I can to finish homework and get passing grades in school. I promised myself before I took the job a year ago that I can't let it get in the way of my education.  Over all I work and study for a total of 70-90 hours every week and have done so for a few months (not counting the summer ofc). I have fun at work and school and I finish things in time but I have noticed myself becoming tired, sad and stressed whenever I have free time. I also fear I'm no longer fun to be with because of my lack of energy and whenever I'm in social situations outside of school and work, I become tired and sorta quite fast. Whenever I'm by myself watching TV or playing video games or whatever I do to relax, I get anxiety and become super stressed. This started happening a few months ago but it's been gradually becoming worse.  Whenever I actually get an opportunity to relax, I feel myself becoming stressed and sad so I find something else to do.

1359,MentalHealthSupport,Struggling to get a bipolar diagnosis,lame_receptor,1,"I'm a graduate student in biophysics. I study signaling networks. For the last couple months I suspect I've been having a mixed manic episode (racing thoughts and grandiosity and everything, but self-conscious enough about how much of a fucking asshole I sound like when I get that way to the point where I'd just not talk at all when I'd start getting manic since I knew people would be able to tell something was wrong with me). A decent amount of time back, I went on bupropion. I felt pretty good for the first week or so and then I just stopped eating and sleeping and just got really fixated and high energy. I didn't recognize it as a manic episode then, because that's just the only state I've even been in when I get any work done.     I recently started on mirtazapine (like maybe a month ago). About a week ago, I broke out from the mixed state I was in and got really manic around a friend. I didn't realize that was what was going on then, but I saw the text he sent from my phone to the roommate who picked me up, and I confirmed it with him and the roommates who saw me that night. I'm still having the racing thoughts and everything now and I'm just trying to keep it together well enough that I don't get myself committed.     I finally got to see a psychiatrist the other day (more than a week after the part of the incident that was obvious to other people) and she tried to tell me that I'm just anxious. I've had anxiety attacks before and this is not the same thing. I'm anxious, but it's because I'm having to be hyperaware of how close I am to losing my grasp on reality right now in order not to. She straight told me she didn't think I was having a manic episode because people usually get committed when that happened, which is both a ridiculous reading of the data and not at all a helpful statement to someone having a manic episode. I thought it had been tapering off a little but I woke up this morning really fucking weird again.     How do I navigate this situation? I feel like I can't win.

I work in ecology, I've lately been on a construction site watching diggers making sure they don't get any animals, the other day the digger disturbed a voles nest, we found 4 tiny baby voles, I had to catch them because the whole area was being dug up, they had no where to run. I made them a nest and put them in a open cotton bag so the mum could come back, we never found the mum and the babies weren't taken away. Other ecologist said I could either leave them there or take them, I knew that leaving them there they wouldn't survive, they were too young and I've seen too many baby animals be killed on this site, so I took them. The other ecologists gave me advice and it seemed ok, they said they'd only need a few more days then they can be released.

The night I came home they seemed really good despite what they went through, I researched what to do and followed it, I spent the whole day yesterday looking after them, checking the temperature of the room, feeding them and helping them go the toilet every 2-3 hours, they stopped wanting milk and started eating the plants and an apple I gave them, I was starting to think one more day and I can let them go. But then, this morning I woke up to them all dead.  All of them, I don't know what the hell happened!

1401,MentalHealthSupport,Climate anxiety,a-chilleus,1,"I’m an anxious person in general, especially social anxiety, but lately I find myself experiencing more and more anxiety over climate change. That seems like a good thing - spurring me on to make changes in my life to harm the planet less. Problem is, I was already doing a lot because my mum has cared about this stuff for decades so I was brought up with composting our food waste and recycling and buying a lot of our clothes secondhand and boycotting palm oil and all sorts else. Also, I know this isn’t enough. Even if I went and lived in the middle of nowhere and never consumed a single thing I hadn’t grown myself in an organic garden and never used anything with fossil fuels again, that would do next to nothing in the grand scheme of things, because of corporations who value profits over the fate of humankind and governments who value the backing of those corporations and maintaining personal power. So, I feel hopeless. Sometimes I’ll be unhappy about where my life is headed and I’ll think of how to change it, but then feel anxious and guilty, because why am I even thinking about career plans when the planet will look totally different by the time I’m forty and before I’m 80 the planet could be near uninhabitable?! That sounds dramatic but it’s possible. We’re already seeing the effects of climate change. I know I should just focus on what makes me happy and what I want to do with my life, and try to do what I can environmentally because feeling hopeless won’t help anyway... but I can’t get it out of my mind.

1459,MentalHealthSupport,Once again my head is spinning I feel distressed and I find myself with more questions than answers to my current situation,TonyRex6,2,"This sounds very similar to how I was about 10 years ago. I was diagnosed with chronic depression / dysthymia. And when you have the big dips they call it double depression.  Having a title and a diagnosis made me feel worse, so did the drugs so I stopped taking them.   Unfortunately it took a tragic circumstance of one of my friends commuting suicide to give me the confidence to speak out publicly. Everyone swarmed to my sides initially to offer their help. After a while it calmed down and my closest friends have now learned that I don’t need pity or anything like that and they have promised to be there when I ask as long as I’m honest and tell them when I’m struggling.

Hopefully someone can give me an advice, if not I’ll try to get professional help.   Last week I made a difficult decision of quitting the school band that I’ve spent since I started on 6th grade. The choice was made due to the strict, unsupportive band directors that started making the band environment from a happy and enjoyable place to somewhere you feel forced to be and not enjoyable. That was a difficult decision, but I started to feel less stress in my daily life just going to school and leaving early. Now I want to cut ties with my friends, I don’t really feel that the connection is there anymore and most of my friends are in band so we barely even each other and honestly even though I thought they supported me for this decision I started to feel a bit judged and I just don’t want to be around them anymore, it feels like I don’t belong there.   I’m having an amazing time with my family, but whenever I’m alone in my room I just wish I had someone special, someone I could love, but at the same time I want to be alone. I’m not really understanding myself and lately I just want to start over in college.

1470,MentalHealthSupport,I need advice,My_Dad_Owns_Reddit,1,"Hi. I'm not sure if this is the place to post this but if not maybe someone can at least help me find somewhere to get help. I'm currently a senior in high school. I met my girlfriend when I was a sophomore and she was a senior. We dated for around a year then she left for college. We dated for an entire year long distance then through that summer too. This year she went back off to college and broke up with me about a month in. I have no idea why. We had an almost perfect relationship for most of it's duration minus the natural amount of small fights you have with someone you're that close to. To put into perspective how close we were people in our school would randomly comment on how we would be the ones that would manage to pull through and be high school sweethearts. While I understand that's very hard to do we were still extremely close and I was and I guess still am extremely in love. I guess fast forward to early September and everything is going great. She made a new group of friends and was happy, we seemed just as in love as ever still sending eachother love notes and buying gifts and all that bullcrap. Anyway one Monday I notice she's not paying as much attention to me as usual but I figured whatever she's out with friends having fun it's all good. Tuesday the same but a bit worse. Wednesday I mention something along the lines of all good can we work this out she says she has felt off this week but we've dated for a long time we'll work through it she's not making any decisions fast. Wednesday night into Thursday morning she sleeps overnight in the same bed as one of the new guy friends she's made at school. She comes clean about it at about 4 pm but I'm obviously still a little upset about it. I have her call me as she hasn't called since Sunday and we usually call every day when she's away. She says it was an honest mistake, she didn't mean to it was innocent and I did believe her but obviously my feelings were still hurt. She goes oh so you're gonna break up with me huh and I say no if course not I don't like it that you did that and I'm upset with you but I'm not breaking up with you it wasn't malicious. Friday she breaks up with me over text after 2 years. Saturday she comes home and refused to see me breifly to talk for closure. She asks me to leave the almost $100 dollars of gifts I got her on her door and she'll pick them up and I said no you have to face me if you want them which she did but she refused to talk about breaking up. She said she still wanted to be friends and now we're not talking. Since breaking up with her over a month ago I have cried almost every day. My performance in sports has stooped to about the level it was in 6th grade and I was a state level athlete last year in the spring. I've held a 4.0 throughout all of highschool and I'm on the verge of failing 3 classes and I have no appetite and I'm losing a lot of weight. I'm currently 6'3 and 148 and losing more weight. It's not uncommon for me to eat 1 meal a day. On days that I have nothing to do it's not uncommon for me to sleep for 14-15 hours. Lately I've started dreaming about her a lot and then I wake up crying. I really thought this would be the girl I married and now she doesn't want me anywhere on her future. Everything happened so fast I have no idea why or how she just stopped loving me and what I did wrong. I haven't thought of suicide yet but my self worth and self image has never been so low. I feel like no one cares about me and no one ever will again and my body image could not be worse than it is right now. I don't know if this is just grieving, this is depression and it will pass or if it's depression and I need to get some kind of help. I'm trying but I have no idea how to get over her and I keep trying to reach out to her and every time I make things worse and end up feeling worse about myself. I don't understand what's wrong with me and why she stopped caring about me and why I can't get over it like a normal person. I've never been affectionate with anyone in my life but her and never connected to anyone in my life like I did with her, not even my own mom. If anyone has any words of advice or even just comfort it would be greatly appreciated  TL:DR: Broke up with girlfriend of two years.

1524,MentalHealthSupport,advice?? please help,hellish_harry,1,"Hi this is my first reddit post so I'm sorry if I'm doing it wrong...  I'm 14 and I'm going into residential treatment soon. My parents live separately but are still married. My dad wasn't ever good with emotionally supporting us but we were extremely dependent on him for money. While my dad lived with us he was very abusive to me and my mom. He wouldn't physically hurt me as much as my mom, but it was still not a very safe household. When he wasn't being his angry self my mom would act the same, except she liked to attack him emotionally.   Now that it's just me and my mom she's been doing that to me and it's not good. I have depression, anxiety, ptsd, bpd, auditory hallucinations, and struggle with ed. She's aware, and present in almost all my therapy sessions, but after years of therapy she isn't really making an effort to change. I could manage before, but she's been getting worse and it's making me go back to habits I broke through years of treatment.  I've told several adults that are aware of my situation, and we've made a plan to contact cps while I'm in residential so I won't be in a dangerous situation. They probably would have encouraged me earlier but my mom tends to put on a persona in public and they only started to believe me when they saw I got worse even though I make an effort to get better.   The only problem is that as it gets closer to me going, I'm getting really anxious about it. I'm terrified. What if my parents really are the only people who will love and care for me?? I've heard of all the crazy stuff that happens with cps and I feel really guilty? I just think that I would ruin two lives just to be able to survive, and it makes me feel like I'm being selfish. My dad has told me that I'm the only thing in his life keeping him from,, you know. My mom already lost a kid, and has never really had a relationship with anyone that wasn't abusive.

1535,MentalHealthSupport,[long] Help me. Where do i go from here.,leafonthewind___,1,"I'm gonna give this another go, since my last post on mental health support for you went completely unnoticed.  I am a seasonal worker, and have been in a relationship with my girlfriend, for 2 and a bit months now but have been best friends for 6/7 and basically been in a relationship without putting a label on it for 3 and a quarter months.   As it is November, we are days away from the end of our contracts. Me and my girlfriend have been on cloud nine since we got together, but over the past two days, shes has shut down on me, told me to stop loving her and basically completely shut me out. This came to a head at our end of season party where we were incredibly happy, with both of us stuck to each other like glue, and i'm not going to lie, my heart skipped a beat when i saw her. Her brown eyes and gorgeous skin glowing underneath the most beautiful green dress fit for royalty. But we left the party and went back to her rooms where she basically completely shut down on me. I told her that i didnt want our relationship to be left here. That real connections are rare and we shouldn't be so quick to let them go. She told me to stop loving her. That i shouldn't have to put up with her bullshit, that its not fair on me.  To give you context, i am currently undergoing professionnal diagnosis for possible bipolar disorder. I have lived with it for as long as i can remember and she has helped me grow, become a better person, and move on from being ruled by my past's scars.  She has her own problems, but i'm not going to discuss that. Those are hers to tell and its not my place to share.  I want to keep this going, i want our relationship to never end. She knows this. Yet she tells me that she doesn't love me, that i should stop loving her, that if i won't stop loving her, then she will stop loving me.  She makes me the happiest man alive. She has become my rock, she is my soulmate, and i know that our relationship can work over long distance. (Opposite ends of the uk.)  But she seems to have already given up and resigned herself to the fact that this is ending whether i want this to or not, that this can't work.  I'm just so confused as to what she feels, because she's told me that i make her so happy, and that she loves me so very much, yet turns round and tells me to stop loving her.    I'm starting to feel like sisyphos, rolling his boulder endlessly up that hill, just for it to reappear at the bottom and have to do it all over again every time i even get slightly close to being happy and having a chance at a normal life it just gets torn from me. She's made me so happy this year, and along with my friends here. shes saved my life, and I'm not quite sure what i'm gonna do without her. Its certainly gonna be lonely as shit, but i'm used to that. My worst fear is losing her, and its all coming true I'm sorry to be chatting all this shit to you, you dont need all my bullshit.  I guess that little voice was right - all the men in my family are alone, bar my dad. They are all either divorced, or never got married in the first place. I'm just like them, meant to be alone.

I moved to this area 2 years ago and have had little luck... I do have 1 girl I hang out with here and there but I do not consider her a “real” friend, and I have really tried to get close to her. Things with her just seem so insincere and forced, and her group of friends are much more extroverted than I and we do not share a lot of common interests.   The last good friend I had was several years ago and was a girl I met on Xbox Live. We never met and in the end, I found out she was cat fishing me; after confronting her (and forgiving her - I still wanted the friendship because I don’t think she faked that), she ghosted me. Since then I have not really made a friend like that... someone I could be messy and open with, call any time of the night, just be a couch potato/watch movies/play video games. I miss her so, so much.   I am just so lonely and I feel incredibly isolated. The closest thing I have to a friend is my therapist and that is obviously not the same thing for many reasons.

1543,MentalHealthSupport,Needing advice on seasonal depression.,MDGaddis,1,"Hi everyone. This is a very new experience for me because I dont like posting a lot of my personal life on social media but I'm wanting advice. Like a lot of people, I get really depressed around the holidays. Everytime I see Christmas decorations anywhere, I just get super sad and close myself off from the world.  Let go ahead and say this but I have absolutely, no reason to feel this way anymore but I've dealt with this ever since I was really young (I'm 23 at the time of posting this). I've always felt like the black sheep around my family because of my differences in appearance, ideas, etc. But ever since I started dating my wife, shes gotten me more interactive with them and learning that they do love me even tho we're different. Her family has always welcomed me with open arms btw.  My friends are the best in the world also. They've known about my depression since middle school, even tho I didn't tell anyone about it till senior year of high school. They love having a Friendsmas, which is awesome, but I always secretly feel like they'd be better off without me there.  I try to fake smiles as much as I can around this time no matter who I'm around. I've never talked about this with anyone other than my wife and friends. I find it hard for me to trust random people because I've always been the outcast my whole life but I'm wanting a neutral 3rd parties' advice on seasonal depression. The rest of the year is hit or me with me. I'm already diagnosed bipolar and I'm on mood stabilizers for it.

1556,MentalHealthSupport,im bulimic and I want to stop,jannator,2,"Hey that sounds really frustrating that you don’t feel safe enough to be able to tell your therapist or family. I’m sorry you’re going through this!   I haven’t had bulimia but I know a bit about recovery from it (one of my close friends went through some major eating disorders but is not well on her way to recovery!). Have you been able to identify what triggers it? What feelings are involved? Often bulimia and other eating disorders have to do with control, perfectionism, past traumas, self-esteem, or stress. Can you identify what factors are involved?  The most helpful thing would be to talk with your therapist. Have you talked with your therapist about clear definition for what would get you sent back to the inpatient hospital setting? If you can set up some sort of guidelines or structure it might make it safe for you to talk to them about it. Or ask to change therapists to someone who is more understanding, if that is possible.  In the meantime, I’d recommend starting to journal your feelings whenever you feel the urge to binge/purge. Try taking up mindfulness meditations so that you can learn to understand what is going on in your head. And I’d also recommend trying Emotional Freedom Technique or EFT (https://youtu.be/frUe2fHJxzA). I haven’t seen this used with eating disorders but I have a feeling that it may be helpful in resisting the urge to binge/purge. In any case, it isn’t dangerous to try even if it ends up not helping. I use it a lot for anxiety.  It’s really important to understand the underlying reasons you feel the need to binge/purge, to improve your negative thinking, and to resolve any emotional issues that may have caused it. If you can’t talk to family or your therapist, try finding other adults who may be able to support you through this. And make sure you’re surrounding yourself with friends who are positive and caring. You don’t necessarily have to share with friends what’s going on but being around people who build you up instead of tear you down is really important for your mental and emotional wellbeing while going through recovery.

I'm 25M *(if that matters)*    *-*  * I'm always somehow the butt of the joke, I do take it well and I usually don't care; and laugh it off. * However, weeks ago I just felt that *""Hey, I'm already 25, I'm an adult and have a voice of my own. If I don't feel comfortable just voice out.* * Voiced out and my *friends* went out telling me that it's just a joke just chill out. Then for some reason, I made a comment along the lines of *You guys can always joke about it, but when I do it suddenly you guys can't take it and say hey just chill out?

The fact that you see this, though, means you can start to change things for yourself.  It isn't easy to start fresh, but believe me, it pays off. I was part of a group of people for a long time who got off on being dicks to each other and starting drama. When I quit drinking, it occurred to me that I didn't enjoy hanging out with these people when I wasn't wasted. But after a while, I just cut myself off. Was it a clean break? No. Plus, I had to spend a lot of time soul-searching to figure out why I gravitated toward that kind of person, despite not enjoying them on a conscious level. It took a lot of hard work, and honestly, it was quite disheartening.  It wasn't the exact same thing you're going through, I know, but they were unhealthy people, total energy leeches, and I couldn't let potential loneliness stop me from putting myself first. I was about your age, too, maybe a little younger. I kept thinking that there was no way to make close friends anymore. For months, I was very isolated. It felt like it would never get better. Despite my fears, I refused to settle for less than I deserved, and I held onto the hope that I would make some real friends someday, even as the year ticked by.  Then, out of nowhere, an email popped up from a random website I hadn't used in years. Still not sure why it came through when nothing else had. It led to me meeting up with a group of strangers, and even though none of us had met previously, we somehow immediately clicked. By the end of the night, an hour-long gathering had turned into nine hours, and we realized we were instant friends. I'm not saying it all works out perfectly or anything, but that was ten years ago, and I still have those people, and more I've met along the way, to lift me up, rather than drag me down.

So I can understand the artist life and when you're sad, you dont want to do anything to your piece. Could be lack of motivation or fear of ruining it. For art funk, I've noticed for me anyway, that doodling and sketching a bit to get into a groove helps. It doesnt have to be everyday, I know a lot of YT artists who say that drawing everyday is a great way to get out of a funk but that's not realistic if you're suffering from depression or just not in a great mind set.

1625,MentalHealthSupport,Living with undiagnosed mental illnesses and struggling to make it as an adult.,bimshe,1,"Hi there. I have never spoken so freely about this topic before, so excuse me if this reads a tad clunky. I am a recent graduate making my 4th or 5th ""go"" at things. My first 4 attempts were all catastrophic. My fear now is that my 5th and final attempt will be the same. I don't want to disclose many personal details, but I will provide what is needed for context.   I live in a 2 bedroom apartment in a not too nice area of town. I stay here with two other roommates. One of which, my old college dormmate, and the other, would be called my girlfriend. I work increasingly long hours at a local electronic repair shop. The pay isn't great, but it gets the bills paid.   I mentioned previously that I had tried making a go of things as many as 5 times. This is true. To explain this further, I have on 5 separate occasions, moved somewhere drastically different (usually with family members) and tried to be an adult. Pay bills, stay employed, stay clean. Each of these attempts have failed. And now with the tool of hindsight, I can see that I sabotaged myself until staying there was no longer a viable option and then I would move on to the next go of things. I would beat myself into these cramped and claustrophobic headspaces and convince myself that all was lost. ""this attempt is too far gone to be salvaged"". I don't know why I do this.   I have seen a psychiatrist only twice. Once when I was 12 years old, and once when I was 16. The first of the times, I was put on bipolar medication, and I can't  remember if it worked or not, the adult responsible for the appointment and as such, responsible for me, did not have my best interests at heart and just wanted a magic pill that would make me ""shut up for once"". The second time I went to a psychiatrist I couldn't open up. I pushed them to just diagnosed me with ADHD so the adults would get off my back and so that I wouldn't have to come to grips with the fact that I may have severe mental illnesses.   To elaborate. My mother's side of the family and my father's side of the family both struggle with severe depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. After doing some research, I believe I may have caught all 3 of these things. The depression is the most obvious for me. I know that I have it. I can't force myself to take care of my body, I can't feel empathy, I struggle to find the energy for basic tasks. The second one, anxiety, is a bit more of a grey area. I'm not sure if I have it or not. It only really gets bad when I'm under a lot of stress, which leads me to believe that it is the stress that causes me to hyperventilate and have seizures. Schizophrenia. I hate that one. I mean no disrespect towards anyone suffering from it. But from my point of view that is the worst mental illness someone can have. That's the one that scares me the most. I believe that the root cause of all my failings as an adult is this disease. I believe that I get a paranoid delusion stuck in my head and I have no way to vent that out and to get back on track. And as such, the stuck delusion just stays stuck. It replays and replays in my head until it has spiraled me down into destruction.   Maybe it's time to give an example of that.  I'll keep it brief and if you would like more details I can elaborate. I mentioned that I worked for a small electronic repair shop. I work there with 3 other adults my age. They all seem so lovely and kind. They seem sweet and caring, they seem like they really got this stuff figured out and I would love to learn a lot from them. But then the delusions started. About a week after I moved into my own apartment, reassured several times by my mother that it would be my last good shot at things, I started to crumble mentally. Currently, I am struggling to fight off the delusion that the guys at work are part of some cult like group that only induct specific members. And since I depend on this job for sustainability, I fear that I am not one of the members they seek. I fear my days are limited and my time there is short. I fear they keep me around to toy with me like some sort of circus monkey. I don't know.  It sounds so ridiculous I know.   I mentioned previously that I live with my old college roommate and my girlfriend. I don't want her to be my girlfriend. I met her in college and she was fine. Sure she had a few red flags but show me someone who doesn't. But once we actually moved in together things are starting to get really bad. I don't want to go on a tirade to tear her down but it's crucial for context. She hardly works, she flips burgers for 5-6 hours a day 4 days a week and comes home to do nothing. She sleeps all day every day and it really irks me because we are in no position financially for that. Additionally, once a day, for the past 3 weeks I believe she has sexually abused me. This is nothing new, my father would do the same thing, but not physically. I come home exhausted from working 14 hour days with a total of 4 hours spent on public transit, and she wants intercourse. I never do, but she never listens. Despite me saying no, that I don't want to, that I'm too tired, she persists. Mounting me or otherwise establishing a sexual contact with me and proceeding to get what she wants. Afterwords I feel even more shallow and hollow.   I'm getting off topic. I'm just a stranger on the internet with a lot of issues. I don't expect everybody to read all of this, I don't blame you. I only hope that just one person reaches out and is willing to talk to me about this. I need help, I need it desperately. I will not have another go at things, this is it, and I can't let it go. But I can't do it alone, my mind just will not have it. Please, if you have any advice or just anything to say to me please don't hesitate to say it.

To the point where she’s not talking to me or refusing to talk to me for days at a time. We’ve had trust issues in the past. But I don’t find my self anxious or worried about things like this. I just worry that this might be the end of the relationship and I’m not really sure how to move forward. I keep finding myself sitting in a room trapped in my thoughts. My therapist suggested today that I get back in to routine of doing things that I may have lost interest in. I took her advice and went out and played basketball with my cousin for about an hour and a half. But after 45 minutes or so I found myself fighting my brain and anxiety. I tried to cope as long as I could but it just got too much and I went home. What are some tips to making it minute by minute? Because i find that part the most difficult.

You could say I was really clingy. So fast-forward about a month (two months earlier from now) Brie decides to end our relationship because of both of our mental health issues. I was devastated, and that's when my OCD got even worse. You thought I couldn't get her out of my mind when I was dating her, well now she's in my mind 24/7.

Just like any persons i am a person with a big dreams, i am dreaming to become a lawyer and philanthropist when i was a kid, and now as an adult person i work as customer service representative on one company, btw let's go to the main reason why i made this post. Firsr of all let's start with a story, it is all about me and my mental state when i get older. When i was on young age this ""things"" is actually not existing at all. I get first honor or second honor when i was on elementary, ecerything is changed when i was 10 years old, this ""thing"" in my head let's call it as my  ego(i do not know if it is the proper term to use) stsrting to disconnect to myself, like i was just a spectator or some sort you know. I always breakdown in school that is why i got always bullied before because i suddenly cried while my teacher is teaching her lessons, i t is so hard to tell everybody on what i actually feel like you are disconnected from your self and you do not know what to do because you are unable to do the things you wanted to do. Because of this even my strict teacher when i was on elementary abused me. This thing in my head gotten worse when i go to junior high, i become less interactive, anti social not like when i was a kid. The symptoms also gotten worse when i saw now patterns that i am aware is not real at all and i saw a ""tunnel thing"" moving forward in my vision everytime i focus on something. At this time my mind become fragile, i have difficulty to remember the names of people i met and unable to remember their faces unless i saw them many times. Because of this the teasing and bullying gotten worse and worse that nobody do not want to interact with me anymore. I really hate the times i disconnect myself in a random times that all i can do is cry alone. Unable to tell this to my family because i have diffficulty of interaction and also i am sxared. When i was in college i took a bschelor of science in sociology master in criminology, there is actually no progression on what the thing in my head and i become more aware of it that i am able to control it in a long span of times, even tho i get tease sometimes i also now got friends and foes, college become the best day of my life due to the fact that everything that i must felt when i was a high school i am now able to feel it on my college days,  on my college days is also the time that i met the girl of my life and her name is sam, she is very special to me. I thoughtthis things in my head are now finally gone, not until i reached 20's it become worse that i got hospitslized due to breakdown. The thing in my head now make me delusional and paranoid and forgetfulness becomes more severe that the previous me who always careful to self becomes self neglect, it become worse that i felt i'vr become dumb and dumb. and anxiety gone worse and the hallucination of the tunnel thing slightly faded but now makes me little drowsy. I do not remember the diagnosis of my doctor all i wanted is to know what the heck really happening in my head, and in many years passed i am now suddenly become obsess of morbid things that in myself i think is normal(?) until i fantasize to kill someone, even think to kill myself. Become self loathed and now i gotten worse. I am now scared to tell everythin to my fsmliy even tho i know they are worried. The spontaneous disconnection the hallucination and a pleasure to hurt something. It is no longer normal that i actually beaten up a kitten to death and i find it satisfying.

1692,MentalHealthSupport,Trust issues,you_are_marvelous,2,"Trust issues are so complicated and delicate and once broken they're hard to repair and it does color your future interactions with people when you've been hurt that deeply.   I have a process that I use that helped me get over my trust issues and I can certainly point you in the direction of the process I use.   I will say that trust is not just a two-person relationship--It's actually a four-person relationship.   Yes, you have to trust them and they have to trust you. That trust between each other has to be earned and has to be mutual. So that's the typical two-person ""trust goes both ways"" type of thing.  However, in my experience, the other two players when it comes to trust is how much you trust yourselves as well. So it's how much you trust them and yourself. But it's also how much they trust you and how much they trust themselves as well.   And bear with me here and I'll explain.   Let's say you're in a relationship (of any kind) and the person you're in the relationship with is a good person, worthy of being trusted, and they trust you and trust themselves to make good choices. However, if YOU don't trust yourself or them, then it will crumble. And the same thing happens in reverse. YOU could be the trustworthy one and trust yourself but THEY have trust issues and it could crumble.   The best advice I can give you is you have to learn to trust yourself first. Trust that you are making the right choices in who you're deciding to forge relationships with, trust that if things go south, you will be there for yourself and work through that heartache of a relationship not working out. Not self-abandoning is huge. If you have a relationship with someone where they hurt you or it doesn't work out and you walk away and don't ever work on those feelings of hurt, abandonment, pain, heartache, disappointment....etc that you have as a result of the fallout, then you are walking around unhealed and with trust issues because you never attended to your own emotional needs when you did get hurt and knocked down.   If you're able to tell yourself ""Hey, I know you're hurting and that person that you trusted broke your heart, but I'm here for you. How can I help you? How can I best support you, love you and help you heal? What do you need from me?"" and then allow yourself to lovingly attend to your painful feelings, then you will build up self-trust. After you have your self-trust in place, it makes it easier to make choices about who to trust. It also lessens the fear of abandonment and pain if/when things don't work out with someone if you know that you will be there for yourself to help you through the pain.   If you walk around feeling raw, tender, and easily triggered, then offering up closeness with someone (which takes trust) feels immensely terrifying and paralyzing. But if you know you will be there for yourself and you trust yourself, the fear diminishes greatly.   So that's taking care of self-trust. What you have zero control over is the other person. You can have self-trust and trust the other person and things can still not work out due to their own issues. But if that happens, at least you know YOU won't abandon yourself and break your heart. You can trust you to be there for yourself. You can trust yourself to attend to those painful feelings.   I hope that makes sense.

1700,MentalHealthSupport,I need help....,hills_teaparty,1,"First I need to explain the background in order to understand the level of stress and fear. It all started when I was staying with my husband and brother in law. I got into a fight with a girl who was supposed to be my friend, and she decided to tell my brother in law a lot of personal stuff that John and I did not want him to know. My baby was 6 months old at this time. So my husband was babysitting my little girl and I had a bad feeling. He always texts me and he answers my calls even if he falls asleep. I called a thousand times and then I received a call from CPS. They said that John left my baby in filth and was using heroin and abusing her. I knew this wasnt true. He had tests weekly on multiple days proving this. It turns out that they drugged him, stole his phone, and literally snatched my daughter and dumped her at a hospital. Since I told the CPS worker on the phone I will pack our things and leave they didn't meet me there and I was able to pick her up. Her doctor checked her over and there was no physical or sexual abuse. I had to return to my hometown and it took a year to find an apartment. I started to rebuild and normalize. But then when my husband got remarried, very strange things began to happen. John's apartment was broken into. Then two weeks after we moved in my apartment there was a guy staring in my window at 5am. I was awake because my daughter woke up crying for a drink and food and I could not move. I was so paralyzed with fear I couldn't move, he looked right at me. John's new wife would act innocent and kind but she was doing a lot behind our backs. Look, I get it, i was the first wife but I was completely respectful. We were buying each other gifts, purses, makeup, etc. She even bought my girl toys and clothes. But then she ran to John's dad and brother who are both absolutely insane (considering they kidnapped my child) and told them I'm destroying their marriage, I actually didnt even know they were married John didnt tell me. She had trichomoniasis and blamed it on me when I don't even have it, and that John and I prostituted ourselves for drugs, that I have AIDs. Because of this I am literally being stalked, harassed, and terrorized. My phone was hacked and sending messages to John and the same happened to him. The spy apps actually appeared on their family's bill. I downloaded apps to detect when my phone was being hacked, and Joe and Sonia literally had access to my phone, they took recordings, read my messages, and got my location. I am scared to death that Joe will kill my daughter and I. The police said I have to come in and file a report which I am doing but I'm pretty certain this will change nothing.   I am diagnosed with generalized anxiety, manic depression, and PTSD. There are days I cannot function. I've been to so many doctors and have had so many meds. The medication for my anxiety does nothing. I am literally making myself so sick that I've developed acid reflux disease. Please be kind, but I am also a recovering pain pill addict. I have no desire to take them and I remain in treatment but it feels like nothing is changing. I'm so sad constantly. I lost my best friend Jacob in 2017 and it's like I'm a hollow person. The PTSD is from years of abuse. When my father died in 2006 I was 14. My mother did not care about being a parent anymore and just fed me pain pills to keep me out of her hair. My stepdad physically and sexually abused me which is why I got married when I was 18. I escaped a cruel man, only to deal with the family who kidnapped my daughter. The abuse from all of them was too much. Even now I panic when I take my clothes off to shower. I have flashbacks. My mother was never a mother, and still treats me like absolute trash. When my daughter and I had to stay with her she argued with me everyday and told me to get out. She demanded my medication, money, anything I had. I thought I would escape that when I moved in my own apartment but she is here everyday screaming for everything. I can do a little but I have a child.

It's true that nothing may come of it, but at least then your story is in a file somewhere that can be referred back to in the event that this escalates further.  Secondly you should try to find a therapist. Therapy has been the single most effective process for my own mental health (depression, anxiety, ptsd). It can be hard finding someone you trust and even harder to open up to said person, but it pays off in that they can help you understand what's going on in your brain and body and point you to techniques and resources that can help. Idk what kind of money you have available to you but there are some free or at least ""affordable"" counsellors or therapists online. You can likely find something that works for you if you look around.  The main thing here is to keep yourself, and by extension your daughter, safe. To do that you may need to cut contact with a few people, including your mother.

1708,MentalHealthSupport,"Gah, numb",shayla_mk,2,"First of all, you sound a lot like me.   And I just want to let you know... you have nothing to feel guilty for.   I am 20 years old and I don’t even have a job because my social anxiety and all around mental state is in such horrible conditions. I’ve felt guilty for so so so long and for so many reasons and I feel like such a burden. Because I feel like I’m not where I’m “supposed to be” or “successful in life” it really gets me down sometimes.   And about you wanting to end your life, I feel that way constantly... I feel like there’s no way possible that I’ll ever be “enough” for this world.. and my parents (mostly my narcissistic mom) make me feel that way a lot also.   But I just want to let you know right now... you are not the problem. It sounds like you’re in the process of healing. And when you’re in the process of healing you are in no way ready for a job or anything “overstimulating” because it can actually make you feel more depressed, anxious, etc. and make you more suicidal. People fail to understand that sometimes. They think you should be doing this, and that, and ALL this stuff. But those people know nothing about mental health and will make you feel guilty for the rest of your life. I truly believe it isn’t you who’s making you feel guilty.. I believe it’s other people who expect certain things from you and lack understanding.  What you need to do is take your mental health seriously, despite what anyone else feels or thinks. And you sound like you need something to comfort you or something to use as a coping mechanism. I have so many of those things. (You may find this weird) but I have baby dolls, stuffed animals, toys, notebooks, art supplies, coloring books, cartoons, etc. that are all MY coping mechanisms and way of comfort.   So it doesn’t matter what this thing is, it doesn’t sound like you want it, it sounds like you need it. And don’t ever feel silly or stupid about it. There are so many people who have so many different ways of coping with anxiety, depression, PTSD, etc. and they are CRUCIAL and very mandatory.   I would suggest (if you haven’t already) tell your parents what you’re dealing with and ask if they will purchase this thing for you because you need something to genuinely help you and could improve your mental health. And if they won’t do it, ask one of your grandparents.. and if they won’t do it, ask an aunt, uncle, etc. just do your best to get what you NEED in order to heal, cope, etc. Also if you go to a therapist.. some therapist are even nice enough to get you something that you can’t get yourself.   There is no shame in it. And there is no correct way to heal/cope. Everyone has their own ways.   Also I would suggest (coming from my own personal experience) if you need to isolate yourself, isolate yourself. If people ask you to do this or that or go here or there with them or people invite you to things or you feel obligated to attend something because you’re afraid of making others upset..... stop that now.  Stop saying yes - Start saying no. (That’s one of my goals for 2020)   Sometimes the best thing for yourself, is just being alone with yourself. Forced interactions and faked enthusiasm is really hard on someone dealing with something internal. Start serving yourself and your own needs. ❤️   I hope you don’t think I’m just “being nice” or trying to pity you. Actually, the only reason I commented on this is because I felt moved to. Just from reading your post I could feel exactly how you felt and have been there myself. And based on the fact you’re in highschool and old enough for a job, I assume you’re 16-18 and those years were some of the hardest for me. Simply because I didn’t know how to value myself and I didn’t understand my own needs because I constantly set mine aside for others. I thought I was young and that anything I said was stupid, didn’t matter, or wouldn’t be taken seriously. And that’s not true!! Age doesn’t matter, if you are being genuine and honest in your words... people should listen!!! Especially if it has anything to do with mental health.   So please, take my advice and don’t feel guilty for doing what you need to do.

I honestly thought I was going crazy so went to doctors, several appointments and some intensive therapy later I get told what had happened to my mind (I nearly went full skitz).

1726,MentalHealthSupport,My partner left me after a paranoid breakdown I had 18months ago,Stoney_Kitten,2,"Hey I see no one commented yet and this all sounds like you're going through a lot. Its never easy learning you have a new mental disorder, especially one that alters your reality so drastically. I know it's hard without your partner right now, but the thing is, even without them, you can still make it through this.   You can't actually get better if you isolate yourself to the arm chair. My husband left me and my world crashed around me and I fell into a heavy depression that I'm still climbing out of, even 2 years later. I only recently actually got over him leaving after a relatively sour relationship that altered my perception of him, and I realized something, if he loved me the way I needed to be loved, if he COULD do that, he would still be here. But he isn't, because even though I needed him, it was in fact too much and unfair of me to want him to stay, but in reality you must let the ones you love go and understand they aren't always gone, there's no telling what the future will hold, especially when both of you make honest efforts to improve your mental health.   You're already working on it, you're taking the right steps and it's okay to rest, but don't become stagnant because otherwise you're wasting your time and your doctors. You can do this, you will feel better, no matter how heavy the weight of the pain, you need to remember it is only temporary. It will pass, time always varies, but this feeling is not your life from here on out.   The next step to take, is to recognize you have support from your medical team, that you can find that control over yourself, and when you slip up (as long as not detrimental to others health) it will be okay, mistakes happen. Something I do, is i take myself on a date. I go to the bookstore and treat myself to my favorite coffee, and I plop down with a random book and just read and disappear from the world for a little while.   Give yourself a break, give yourself a day to just get lost somewhere, the bookstore or the woods, a restuarant or the movies. Find yourself in the crowd again.

If you are willing to share just message me, my inbox should be open! Your stories can be as long or as short as you want, also you may remain anonymous, but if you are okay with it I am just asking for your name, age, and where you are from.     Here is a part of my story that I will be sharing during the presentation as well:  &gt;There have been many times in my life where I think I am talking to a friend that really does care and will help me through my situation but as soon as I reveal anything to them they dismiss my feelings as something normal that everyone at some point in their life goes through. This was the response that I received when I disclosed to the first person ever that I was cutting myself. One of my friends in high school acted as if it was not a big deal that I was purposefully harming myself in order to find calmness while dealing with all of my emotions. This was in 2011, my freshman year of high school, to treat me at this point my parents put me into group therapy that was once a week. This was a good step by them, they supported me getting help and were open to talking about what we discussed each week in the session. The one thing that my parents did that I will never understand is that it seemed like they never told any of my three sisters what was going on. My therapy sessions were simply referred to “appointments” and when they did talk to me about the sessions it was only on the way home immediately after they were done. This is the first time that the stigma of mental illnesses worked against any of the progress that I would have made. I never talked about my struggles with my sisters and simply put on a normal face that people expected to see after therapy treatment and managed to make it to my high school graduation with only minimal set backs due to my anxieties and depressive episodes.

1745,MentalHealthSupport,How do I actually “help myself”?,Annimasaurus,2,"The thing is you are helping yourself and you are not doing something wrong. It seems to me that your friend has no idea how to support someone with a mental illness. Her job isn't to 'fix' you, in fact she cant. What she can do is listen and show compassion.  You are obviously working so hard to to make yourself better and that is really strong of you. It sounds like you are dedicating a lot of time and energy to recovery. The issue isn't that you are not helping yourself but that you haven't found something that works for you. Unfortunately I dont have the answer as to what will work.

I've had bad intrusive thoughts before - and since I've been in therapy for close to 2 years now I have actually gotten pretty good at dealing with them. But a year ago it went from only those thoughts to actual  Attacks.  I'll describe the latest one;  It was around 11pm - I was on the phone with my Fianceé when I suddenly felt like my entire room was slowly tilting forward, the walls suddenly seemed alive (?) Looked like they were breathing.  A sense of slight paranoia was suddenly present and my breathing sped up considerably as well as my heartbeat. And then I was bombarded with horribly vivid images of perfect strangers getting torn apart alive, accompanied by every sound they made. I wasn't the one doing it either - I recognized none of them and there isn't any patter between them as far as I can tell.  My body was twitching and I was crying uncontrollably- I was aware that it wasn't real intellectually but it felt like it was happening right infront of me.  That lasted for approximately 30 Minutes and I was left sobbing and upset - a feeling of dread present which permeated the next 2 Days before I was finally getting a little better again.  These attacks are presently happening in the span from anywhere between 6 Months and 3 weeks apart and seem to be completely unpredictable.  I've talked to a Myriad of Doctors and a long list of Mental Health professionals - and none of them knew  how to deal with this.

Lately I’ve become totally obsessed with a certain celebrity. Like to the point I’m blocking out what’s happening in my actual life to look at photos, watch videos, and basically just creep them. Today I had a moment where I was “aware” of myself of what’s going on here and now. I broke down. I started sobbing thinking about how I can’t possibly afford to have cancer again. How I would be financially damaging to my family to be diagnosed again. Suicide would be a cheaper option. No I’m not considering it. I just know it would be cheaper to just bury me than to try and fix what’s wrong. I know this doesn’t make sense. It doesn’t make any sense at all but I still felt like I am self medicating by using YouTube and tumblr to watch this person.  I can’t really explain how much my every thought has been about them lately. Like not imagining we have a life together but just thinking about what they are doing now or what kind of music they like or what kind of coffee they prefer.

I'm not sure where it comes from or why in the moment I can't seem to think of the pain my actions will cause. It's been this way for years. I'm an introvert and I keep a lot of the inner parts of me to myself. Partly because of my introversion but also partly because I'm scared how this part of myself will hurt those I care about.   I've often been told by those closest to me that they sometimes wonder who I am. ""Who are you?"" I don't know how to answer. It kills me to hear that. It feels like an accusation. An attack aimed directly at me and my deepest insecurities, but I wonder if they're right. I know they're right. Do you know what it feels like to have someone you love look you in your eyes and tell you they don't know you? It feels like a weight that gets heavier each time you try and breathe through the pain those words caused in your body. And the look in their eyes makes that weight gets heavier and slowly crawls into your chest and makes its way into your throat to choke you and all you can do is sit there numb and helpless and exhausted.   I do crazy things I can't explain sometimes. I've never ran away leaving people I love behind, I've never taken a stranger home from a bar I've never ran out into the street without looking both ways, and I've never jumped off a one story house to see if I'd land on my feet. But I have hurt people. People that I love have cried and hurt and have questioned everything because of my own thoughtlessness. Because of my words from my mouth.   I want those closest to me to feel like they know me. I don't want to be a stranger. I don't want someone to always wonder what it is I really am up to whenever I'm not in their sight. I so badly want to get better. For those I love, but also for myself because I also look at myself and ask who am I?

Im not sure if this will help to hear any of what I'm going to say but Last February I found out that my Grandma had stage 4 ovarian cancer and had a complete breakdown, I don't self harm often but I did then. My Grandma is still with us but refuses to move in with a family member and also refuses to move anywhere other than home, she doesn't want to see any of her grandchildren as she is too proud for us to see her in the state shes in and I've found that extremely difficult to cope with as she can barelytalk on the phone for a few minutes. A lot of her care has been taken over by my Mum, who is struggling to cope with it as shes also about to go through a divorce. I don't live closely so can't help or support her and I'm going through a lot with my health and she can't really be here for me as she obviouslyhas bigger priorities ( which I completelyunderstand ).

I may be unconventional in the way I approach my own mental health.  I have decided to opt out of pharmaceuticals (mostly because I always have way more side affects then benefits)  This is a decision that I have been happy with. I've done a lot of scientific and historical research in order to find alternatives and when I was in more control over my own life I was doing really well physically and mentally.  Another thing is I use journaling and mindfulness techniques.

I was disrespected continuously for this method and some even actively sought out to make it more difficult for me to take care of myself.  On top of all that people used my religion to discredit any scientific data I had.

So this is honestly kind of a PSA. I'm not here to pill shame people and I understand that some people do that. But I don't think that me using a different method for my own health invalidates anyone else's. I just want to be able to exist and take care of myself in the way that has consistently worked for me.

I did spoke to my therapist about this the day before and use the Dailet behaviour therapy skills but it didnt work for me.

1842,MentalHealthSupport,Does it ever REALLY get better?,dumpsterivory,1,"F21 here.  I don’t know anymore, I really don’t. I feel so ungrateful that I even feel like this now. When I was younger I didn’t feel so guilty, I had no one, but now, I have a great support network.  My girlfriend is great, obviously she supports me the best she can, sometimes she doesn’t say the right things but I can see so clearly she’s trying.   My mum and dad are better, they’ve supported me and acknowledged that they haven’t always been there for me and have helped me start to see a real psychologist.   Uni, that’s another fuck around. I was so depressed in first year I failed two subjects, no one but my gf knows. I’ve dropped down from a double degree to a single nursing degree. Idk if it’s even what I want to do anymore and I’m going into my fourth year. Is it a waste to give up now? Of course even I know that. Have I been doing it to please everyone? I kinda enjoy it, helping people makes me feel like I’m making a difference. The whole reason I wanted to be a nurse was because I honestly didn’t think I’d last thing long, and why not try to help others in my waste of an existence. Seeing the way other nurse treat people makes me feel sick, I’m way too empathetic. I feel like my depressed brain doesn’t retain any information. What if I’m the reason someone doesn’t get better? It makes me want to vomit.  My whole life I’ve grown up with others telling me I’m not good enough, but when I think about it I think it was mainly me the whole time. I don’t know how to stop. I really don’t. Even if it’s not 24/7, I’m a piece of shit. I don’t know why.   My psychology doesn’t really listen, I can see she’s trying to help me, but I feel like she’s just going through the steps she has been taught, not listening to me. But at the end of the day I feel like actually getting into my fucked up brain is way above her pay description.  A guy tried to kiss me at a club and I had a full blown panic attack. After it happened I went outside and asked someone for a cigarette and burnt myself with it. I haven’t self harmed for ages and I felt dirty after, I don’t want people seeing that. I was assaulted when I was very young but to be honest I never think about it. My psyc tries to tell me that’s where some of my deep problems stem from but tbh, I don’t even remember it that much. I don’t want to and I think I’m ok with dealing with it like that.    I don’t even know what I’m trying to ask in this thread. I suppose does it ever get better? I mean I feel so selfish. I’m not a depressed piece of shit 24/7 anyone, drugs helped me cope with that (weed, mdma, and about 20 lsd trips later, half of them bad) but my god sometimes it’s a slippery slope. I try so hard to make people like me. I’m constantly thinking about things no one gives a fuck about - it’s all in my head. I talk to much to cover it up which just makes it worse.   I just want to know, do you ever stop hating yourself? Even if it’s not full blown, I want to stop brining myself down every chance I get.

I can't accurately judge your therapist, but you should be working on goals that you want to accomplish. Like one of your main goals of therapy should be learning how to love yourself and you should be taught tools in which to do so. Maybe your therapist is giving you tools and you just aren't using them or listening, I don't know. But if they aren't, then it's time to find a therapist that's actually doing their job.  From past experience, I know that it takes both parties giving 100% for therapy to work. My therapist can be great, but if I'm not totally honest and willing to do the work, then I'm not going to make any progress. The same in reverse is true. If I'm giving 100% and my therapist sucks, then I'm not being supported and helped in the right ways and they're not a good fit for me.   To answer your question, yes, I've stopped hating myself. I love myself now. But it took, not only a lot of work to get to this point, but I've had to be willing to take personal responsibility for the choices I was making and how I was contributing to my own misery.

I agree with that 100%. If you think it's not going to work and/or you don't feel any different or see progress when you are trying, everything feels futile. It's such a defeating feeling!  I'll be really honest with you--I ADORED my therapist and I think he is fucking rad and he helped me tremendously in so many ways. That being said, what pushed me into the workshop I mentioned above was the fact that I was so incredibly TIRED of hating myself. I was literally afraid I was going to die (either by my own hand or natural causes) never having loved myself. I was desperate. It's not that my therapists techniques and tools didn't work and that I wasn't addressing past issues of abuse, self-hatred...etc. I was. But at the end of all of that, I still felt I was like the one mistake the universe made. Like Hitler wasn't a mistake, but I am. I'm the defect the universe wish they could erase.   I don't feel that way now and since applying the techniques I've learned in that workshop...and that's going on over 5 years now.  My point being--I understand. You have to feel like you're not just treading water and getting nowhere. You have to feel like you're making progress AND that you're worth saving instead of just letting you sink to the bottom. And it's REALLY difficult to get out of that head-space when you're in it. I call it being down the rabbit hole.   For now, I would just try to be as kind as you possibly can to yourself. Talk to yourself and treat yourself as you would your best friend or a child you were taking care of. If you wouldn't do it or say it to them, then don't do it to yourself.

1854,MentalHealthSupport,Bad social anxiety,edgyimp,1,"Hi I was wondering if yall have an advice for bad social anxiety. I’ve had it since pre teens and I’m in my early 20s now and started my first adult job about 9 months ago. My job entails me to work closely with two other guys (I’m F) and we basically do the same lab job just at different shifts- I’m night shift. But I still interact with them and others till around 2200 and then its only a couple people across the hall from me that I don’t see too often till midnight or later.   All this to say I’m pretty alone in comparison to most people but just that little bit of interaction is suffocating me. Also the fact that I think people watch what I do, or people talk about me and I have no way to find out given I’m not around the rumor mill. I’ve not had a close guy friend and so the new people and different gender and trying not to mess up around them has gotten to me. I’m starting to have panic attacks at work and at home. I don’t want to go to work but if I didn’t it would be suspicious cause I’m viewed as the go getter in our little group since I like to ask a lot of questions.   Do yall have any way to help with this? I’m looking around for a therapist or someone to talk to since I did that years ago and it seemed to lessen the panic associated with my anxiety but I can’t get in touch with anyone soon - more like weeks out. I just think I’m going crazy and I can’t breath around them. I cry with my panic attacks and I know if I look or act off- I’m usually fairly happy looking/acting- that they’ll notice- the guys are very perceptive- and the fear that they know or will find out and make assumptions is killing me.   Also they tend to joke around a lot and sometimes too much with me and end up going to far a couple times already. I’ve also tried to distance myself from that when I thought it was too much for me but they end up sucking me back in cause I like to joke around too and we have similar humor but then it gets too much and it just cycles. I don’t want to make too much of it though cause I don’t want to strain the relationships or the job environment since it is just a few of us at a time.

And realising that for every new person and situation I need to be open to learning new ways of doing things, seeing things, and relating both myself and others.  - Cutting out negative influences, I.E. Certain music I used to listen to.   - Changing bad habits: Deleted all social media and only log in to Instagram and facebook for business related tasks.

So below is what I’ve started to write about my life. I started it as a way to deal with the things going on in my head. I’m 33 years old and recently stopped smoking weed (please be patient with me here) I have gone through spits and spats of smoking weed. Some times longer than others. I always tell myself I can deal control this just one a day. Just to help you drift off to sleep, but inevitably it turns into a habit to the point where I’m smoking pretty much an ounce a month. I’m a postman so I end up with quite a bit of spare time, where friends are still at work when I finish.... So I smoke to fill the long afternoons at home alone with my dog because I don’t want to spend all day down rabbit holes with my thoughts. So now nearly after nearly a year of solidly smoking every day without fail, I’ve finally decided I need to face my demons and try and sort my mental health out. I’ve joined the gym, I’m learning to play the harmonica and also looking to start a podcast with a close friend. Oh and stopped smoking weed. The withdrawals are horrible but that for another thread!  I’m suffering from what is called child hood trauma. Below is the beginning of me blogging, logging, story telling I’m not sure quite what you would call it, but it’s me stating facts about what has contributed to this mental state I’m now in. It’s not very long and as it’s been extremely tough to write and relive in my head, but has helped me to start thinking about entertaining the idea of dealing with my inner demons.   Kind redditers, I would like some advice/feedback/help on whether people think by me telling my story would help others? Is it the best thing for me to do? Also the best way to go about writing this in a format that’s organised and reader friendly. As you can tell I’m no story writer, my language/writing ability isn’t very high. Any advice would be gratefully appreciated.

I must before I hit the self-destruct button. I have dealt with depression for most of my life, not very well either I would like to add. I can’t support a relationship, I suffer from trust issues, jealously or take people for granted. I’m now 33 years old, have been single for 6 years through fear of not being good enough for whoever is unlucky enough to fall me.  It all started when I was 10 years old (or so I believe although my childhood before this point was never completely stable). My dad left our family, leaving my mum to raise two boys (this is how the picture was painted). I stepped up to the best of my ability to support my mum, who spent countless nights on the phone to her parents seeking the support that me and brother needed from her. We would come home from school and mum would just be a mess. Now I don’t know what it feels like to be with someone for a such a long time to then one day not have them, but what I do know is you don’t abandon your responsibilities as a parent. She could still function as human as in cook, clean, cloth us and bathe us, but it never felt the same since that day. Almost resentment, looking back now it felt as if me and my brother were pawns in the most sadistic game of chess ever played in my eyes. What I later realised (very late on in my life) the relationship of Mother and Son was no more.  Now at this point in my life, I’ve just completed my SAT’s in primary school, getting ready for my first big transition in life to secondary school. A daunting time for any child.  My first two years at secondary school was absolute hell, I would go to school in the morning kicking and screaming, not wanting to leave my mum. I would get to school and go straight the MI room (school nurse) break down in tears and refuse to go to class because I couldn’t accept my parents splitting.  I would starve myself every day, refusing to eat lunch. I would be in class and just break down crying (hysterical at times). This of course made me an easy target and eventually led to later in my school life being bullied.   *My recollection of events may not represent the right timeline*  Whilst school life was not going so well, home life wasn’t much better. I am struggling to remember everything about this time in my life, I’m pretty sure my brain has shutdown big parts of my childhood to protect myself.  As I previously stated, my brother and I were being used as weapons against my dad. My mum would guilt us into not wanting to spend time with our dad, poisoning our minds against him. Of course, we were young and easy to manipulate. We thought we are supporting our mum, because Dad left us not the other way around. Now my dad was no knight in shining armour during this time, he would pick us up, drive us two minutes up the road and question us about what my mum was up to. He was seeing someone.

2004,MentalHealthSupport,Childhood Abuse Survivor turned Trauma Informed Life Coach for other Survivors of Domestic Abuse -- Free Resources,coach_jess,1,"Hello everyone! I am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect. I have spent my ENTIRE life learning about psychology to try to understand what happened to me, why, and the effect it has had on me and my life. I spent so much of my life trying to figure these things out and then trying to heal from the traumas. There was a long period of my life where I was just completely miserable, hopeless, angry, scared, worried, sad, hurt, depressed, anxious, and so on…    I have since turned my life around completely. I started my first business while I was completing school for counselling. At the same time, I was still working through therapy. When I accomplished all I could through therapy, I was in a stable place. I was able to function and survive. However, I still wasn’t living the life I wanted and had no idea HOW to get it.    This is when I hired my first Business Coach. Working with her, I learned a ton about coaching, an area I knew nothing about. After gaining some different skills through Coaching, I was able to finally pinpoint what it was that I needed after my completion of therapy left me stable, but aimless: a Coach.    I needed a Coach who had a background in mental health work. I needed a Coach who understood what I was going through, what I had done in therapy, and what I should focus on or work towards next. Unfortunately for me, this type of Coach didn’t yet exist. Instead of this discouraging me, I decided to become this Coach instead.    I have taken my experience previously working as a Probation Officer, my education and experience in psychology and counselling, and my experience and passion as a survivor of domestic abuse and created a Trauma Informed Life Coaching program. This program empowers survivors of any type of abuse at any point in their lives to break the negative conditioning the abuse as had on them and to create and live a life that is genuinely happy, healthy, and successful.    I have also created a social media platform associated with my Life Coaching practice to provide as much free information, support, and resources as possible to any and all survivors that are interested (including a 3 day workshop about anxiety):  Instagram: [https://www.instagram.com/lifepluscoaching/](https://www.instagram.com/lifepluscoaching/)   Facebook: LifePlus Coaching – [https://www.facebook.com/lifepluscoaches/?eid=ARC0AvvPKf7bqkk0rOelYUAP0OMDnJfksifhgacPokqmZsW\_QrzGpJwlMZbC0lThgiNmleAgBOlIsgk2](https://www.facebook.com/lifepluscoaches/?eid=ARC0AvvPKf7bqkk0rOelYUAP0OMDnJfksifhgacPokqmZsW_QrzGpJwlMZbC0lThgiNmleAgBOlIsgk2)   Facebook Group: Better Than Okay – [https://www.facebook.com/groups/637665736992253/?ref=direct](https://www.facebook.com/groups/637665736992253/?ref=direct)   Website: LifePlusHelp.com",1.0,1.0,-0.9032,negative,encouraging,,"['hello everyone!', 'i am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect.', 'i have spent my entire life learning about psychology to try to understand what happened to me, why, and the effect it has had on me and my life.', 'i spent so much of my life trying to figure these things out and then trying to heal from the traumas.', 'there was a long period of my life where i was just completely miserable, hopeless, angry, scared, worried, sad, hurt, depressed, anxious, and so on…    i have since turned my life around completely.', 'i started my first business while i was completing school for counselling.', 'at the same time, i was still working through therapy.', 'when i accomplished all i could through therapy, i was in a stable place.', 'i was able to function and survive.', 'however, i still wasn’t living the life i wanted and had no idea how to get it.', 'this is when i hired my first business coach.', 'working with her, i learned a ton about coaching, an area i knew nothing about.', 'after gaining some different skills through coaching, i was able to finally pinpoint what it was that i needed after my completion of therapy left me stable, but aimless: a coach.', 'i needed a coach who had a background in mental health work.', 'i needed a coach who understood what i was going through, what i had done in therapy, and what i should focus on or work towards next.', 'unfortunately for me, this type of coach didn’t yet exist.', 'instead of this discouraging me, i decided to become this coach instead.', 'i have taken my experience previously working as a probation officer, my education and experience in psychology and counselling, and my experience and passion as a survivor of domestic abuse and created a trauma informed life coaching program.', 'this program empowers survivors of any type of abuse at any point in their lives to break the negative conditioning the abuse as had on them and to create and live a life that is genuinely happy, healthy, and successful.', 'i have also created a social media platform associated with my life coaching practice to provide as much free information, support, and resources as possible to any and all survivors that are interested (including a 3 day workshop about anxiety):  instagram: [https://www.instagram.com/lifepluscoaching/](https://www.instagram.com/lifepluscoaching/)   facebook: lifeplus coaching – [https://www.facebook.com/lifepluscoaches/?eid=arc0avvpkf7bqkk0roelyuap0omdnjfksifhgacpokqmzsw\\_qrzgpjwlmzbc0lthginmleagbolisgk2](https://www.facebook.com/lifepluscoaches/?eid=arc0avvpkf7bqkk0roelyuap0omdnjfksifhgacpokqmzsw_qrzgpjwlmzbc0lthginmleagbolisgk2)   facebook group: better than okay – [https://www.facebook.com/groups/637665736992253/?ref=direct](https://www.facebook.com/groups/637665736992253/?ref=direct)   website: lifeplushelp.com']","[ 0.     -0.8519  0.     -0.4939 -0.9782  0.      0.      0.6249  0.

2005,MentalHealthSupport,Constant fat shaming by family members led up to social anxiety and serious self worth issues,rhaars,1,"Yeah. Title sums it up.  Never thought I would end up putting this on the internet but yeah. My family has been fat shaming me for as far as I can remember. And they don't stop ever. Recently they picked up an old picture of mine (5 years back) and said that I looked so much better and skinnier back then. I was told that I looked ugly even back then. And I am being told that even now. When you are younger, you get bullied for being fat. Funny part is that I never got bullied head on. I am assuming that my classmates would make fun of me behind my back. I used to get bullied by my parents for being fat and eating excessively.   I am 21F South East Asian and being skinny is required for women to be even accepted as one. Soon I will be forced to get married and if you aren't skinny you aren't qualified to be a bride (I don't want to be one either but lol that is a different breakdown.) I am 98% sure that this constant pressure on me to loose weight and primarily to eat less (because eating is the only way you gain weight no other reasons obviously right) has made me socially anxious. I always feel like I am taking up more space or that people don't want to see my stupid fat face. I cannot eat peacefully when I am in a social setting because my brain constantly recites ""people are looking at you and judging you for stuffing your face."" I feel guilty for borrowing food from my friends because my brain immediately wires it to eating more than already given hence gaining more weight. I legit say ""sorry for eating all your food away"" everytime I borrow something as small as a cookie. I don't think this is normal. To explain the extent of this problem, off late I have been eating only one meal a day and that makes me feel sick and guilty. I HAVE BEEN FEELING GUILTY TO EVEN EAT.   I cannot proceed to live like this. I want to be able to help people in the future and be successful. My mental issues with self worth are a serious hurdle for me to face. I know that I can do much better if I could raise my self esteem and I have tried so many ways. I have failed. And I really need help. I cannot let my own family pull me down.

My dad then brings up how I need to take care of my hair, which I've been neglecting because I never cared and I couldn't bring myself to start (instead just sitting in the shower for hours, attempting and failing and hating myself for not being able to untangle my hair).

I'm gifted as well and never had to make any effort until I graduated high school. I didn't have the highest marks, because I cared more for other stuff, but I could easily have high enough marks to pass without ever really studying. I think everyone needs something to rely on when it comes to their self-esteem. For me that was the fact that I was quick to understand things and I could draw really well.  Then I went to art school and had to drop out after 3,5 years because I just couldn't keep up anymore. I had already had to redo one of my years and the pressure was just too much. My creativity was dried out and I had taken on a very big project that was going absolutely nowhere. I took half a year off and just used it to write smutty fanfictions with a friend who had also dropped out.

2107,MentalHealthSupport,I don't know how to help my sister. The delusions are worse. [8/F],Russian_Graveyard,1,"Hi! I'm Van and this is a throwaway account suggested by Ame, my other older sister. The one I wanna discuss here today is Ivy.  Ivy's amazing. I love her! She raised me. But, her paranoid delusions are getting worse. I guess I just want help knowing how to deal with it? I'm still new to being alive in a way. I've asked them to leave while I write this.   For some context (oops, I know I've started this off randomly. This is my first Reddit post!) we share the same body. We're split mentally. I don't remember most of our past, I only came around maybe . . . 4 years ago? Anyway, blah blah. As far as I've seen snooping in their memories, Ame was around agesss ago. Her first memory must have been 4-5! But, I know Ame. The girl described back then? Generous, kind, friendly. It can't be her. Or if it is, she really went through some dramatic changes. So, Ivy came around about 8 years ago? She dedicates her life to helping others. I don't think she has a single enemy.   Each one of us was created for a purpose, but we are human. I think. I feel human, so whoop de do. And Ivy's purpose was to be friendly to everyone on the internet — become the perfect internet girl. So friendly, mature, funny. And Ames was to get though primary school (UK is fun!) where she was in a fake military group (kids who swore a pact to join or somethin' they were gonna die together. All they seemed to do was playfight). So, if Ame has always been cold and heartless who is this kind girl? Yeah well Ivy's panicked over that. Still have no clue.  More context! Ivy went into an anxiety fit where she went into a deep dark hole of depression like symptoms. Ya know, numbness and stuff. Sooo, Year 9. One day she does the arm business to get out it and yeah. She doesn't remember anything before that. Ame does, but she didn't. Slowly she's been regaining a few memories.   Why couldn't we use Ames memories? So, secondary school. Where I was created! Yay! Anyway, Ivs had seriousss anxiety to be a perfectionist. 100% marks, no behavioural sanctions. All her anxiousness drowned us out. We got her memories, lost when she did. I was only around to smile to her friends. She called me the mask. I only became human after she broke down so much they put her on sertraline, so me and Ame could exist :D  So, Ivy slowly regaining memories. The issue. She only regained the bad ones. The ones about the past that Ame tried to hide. Abuse, basically. I don't want to go in detail. Some we have confirmed are real. The physical ones. But mentally and verbally? She no longer trusts her memories. None of us do. We bring them up, she's shouted at that she's made them up. It's all in her head. It never happened. It was no longer just the abuse this happened. It was things like . . . Paid lessons. ""You never told me we had a lesson booked."" But in her memory she did. Small things. Ivy doesn't trust herself anymore.  And when we found out that whoever it was back then couldn't have been Ame, she's gotten worse. She keeps on thinking about it, who it was. Was it her who went through that trauma? She read an article one day that gave her less answers: did she kill them? The idea was heartbreaking to her. This part was only a month or so ago, let's say.  This isn't the first case Ivy hasn't trusted herself. She had a friend last December, called Annaliese. She was what Ivy said was a ghost. Ivy was incredibly sick at the time. She said the memories the ghost showed her linked to the ones she got in Year 7 when she had pneumonia. They were the same images. She said they communicated through sending shivers through her body and she instinctively knew. She did impulsive things that were odd, such as buy something on a game that before the 'ghost' had wanted it she hated. I don't believe in the paranormal but looking through, I see why she did. Ivy had countless nights were she heard things, tracing back to Year 5 or earlier. Voices. Footsteps. Doors opening and closing. Sounds of (people brushing teeth? Why you gotta be weird here Ivs). In our house we have a heavy oak door. The glass windows are double paned. There is no entrance on our floor to the outside, apart from a staircase to the ground floor. The door is in an enclove in the wall. This door opens and has a freezing breeze even during summer in the gap between the frame and itself. I think she really did her head in.  They were okay for a year. A few nights ago she heard noises again. It was an old telephone ringing eerily. High pitched, slowly. And then it stopped. She heard a click. She left the room. She saw something. I think it was a shadow, or created by her mind, but she screamed. Since then she's been terrified to sleep and every little thing scares her. We turned a corner in the dark to see a broom and he first thing she saw was a face! Ame watching horror movies to tease Ivs isn't helping but she won't stop. I'm the youngest, kinda have little power. Help ?   Off topic, but when Ivy goes into her paranoid anxiety attacks nothing we can say stops her. In her words ""parasites in my mind, the words dig themselve sin and any trigger words make them all scream at me"".   Mental health services . . . We were in them for a year. Ivs helps people out mentally online. She's got tens of people to better places, to rescue her own mind knowing she can help others. She was helping this boy. Alcoholic, suicidal. He was one of the ones who couldn't trust authority yet; needed clarity he wasn't alone; was still edgy (can't think of better word) and couldn't see hope. So she spoke to him how he used to feel. Someone got the texts. Someone handed them in. Someone forced her to give his name. She was forced to speak about her own problems to them because of what she said, despite saying it was an act, so she made things up and said not to contact her case holder. They did. Now Ame is in her head whispering again that trusting them was bad in the first place. She doesn't trust anyone. Ivy trusts too easy. The boy ended up badly injured self-inflicted after  being shouted at by his abusive father, who the someone informed despite Ivy's warnings. He was offline for days after Ivy was forced to hand him in. She was terrified.   Please help me. I don't know what I can do to help her. Shes worked with tens of people. She's heard it all before. I just want her to stop being so afraid all the time. It scares me. She's my big sister. Tonight she saw the shadow move. Tonight we aren't sleeping again. It was a wardrobe and her moving her head too quickly. I don't know what to put. I don't know what I want. Please help us. I don't even know how. I just want to calm her down.

2139,MentalHealthSupport,I feel like a failure.,in-other_wordzzz,1,"I have OCD, anxiety, and major depressive disorder. I’ve had to deal with these since elementary school. I’m on several medications and usually have to change my prescription every 6 months or so because the medication eventually looses its effect. Since this whole COVID 19 stuff I’ve been able to deal with it pretty well for the first week or two but my anxiety has started acting up causing ticks. Some of those ticks are grunting, taking shallow breaths and holding it, opening my eyes as wide as I can, spreading my fingers and toes as wide as I can, and some other things.  So I’m in my second semester of a vet tech program. This program is pass or fail and you have to keep your overall grade above a 75%. It’s a very intense and fast paced 2 year program. Last semester I struggled a bit but passed all my classes. This semester I started out very well and was applying new study habits despite my only friends from the previous semester cutting contact with me out of the blue. I had B’s by the time spring break started. I was proud since my grades have improved a whole letter grade compared to the previous semester. Then this COVID 19 stuff happened and got kicked out of the dorms and my classes moved to online. This program is very hands on and half of it is labs. Which was good because I learn better in the classroom and doing hands on stuff. So these online classes have been a huge adjustment and a big stressor. I’m struggling finding assignments and staying caught up on everything. I’ve been busting my ass these past couple of weeks working from 9-5 Monday through Friday working on homework. I’ve also been taking small breaks in between like working on a puzzle, walking dogs, or watching an episode on Netflix. I’m turning everything in and doing my best but my grades are barely hovering over a 75% and my lowest grade is now a 64%.

2139,MentalHealthSupport,I feel like a failure.,radicalzb,2,"Hey! Sorry for the incredibly late reply on this! I saw nobody had responded so thought I'd hop in! Also, just FYI, I am by no means a mental health expert or anything, but I'll do my best! And if it helps at all, I am also a fellow medical student...  Firstly, I'm really sorry to hear that you are feeling this way. While I personally don't have any diagnosed mental health conditions, like you, I've often felt like just giving up on my studies entirely and taking the easy way out, so to speak. But you know what? Looking back now I don't regret a thing! Sure, my grades weren't as good as I had hoped, and yes they were some very intense and stressful times in my life. But I've found that one way or another, everything will always fall into place for you sooner or later!  I failed to qualify for University (college) here in the UK at first so I had to take an additional year long general healthcare course in order to do so, but I got there in the end! So even if you somehow don't get the grades expected of you, I assure you that there are always alternative routes to pursuing your goals! Also, I'm not sure about in the US, but in the UK, most companies/services have said that they were going to be more lenient on those who were receiving their grades this year, as they understand that most people's studies and marks would be negatively impacted as a result of COVID, so don't lose hope just yet!  I also know the pandemic has been hard on everyone mentally, myself included. However I can't imagine how much harder it must be for you, so you have my deepest sympathies... If possible, it would certainly help to talk to others close to you about how you feel if you haven't already done so. Or I'm also more than happy to chat if you feel the need... 🙂  Anyway, I wish you the best of luck with everything! I'm sure whatever happens, you'll be absolutely fine!

2578,MentalHealthSupport,My ptsd is getting in the way of my relationship,sadkidsid,1," I was in a verbally abusive relationship from the ages of 17-22 by a kid who couldn’t break his own abusive cycle. He recycled all his abuse he experienced from being abused as a child onto me. One common theme was that I was unlovable and that no one else would love me except for him. And I believed it. He gaslit me, yelled every morning starting at 6am, took every dime I made, and controlled my every move. I lost all of my friends and I am only now making those connections back. I kicked him out after he shot the gun in the house.    I am now almost 28 and his words still fucking stick. I’ve tried some therapy but never found a therapist that stuck. I met an amazing man when I wasn’t looking for it (surprise surprise) and now my traumatic memories that I’ve buried and tried to forget are being triggered by small things. One phrase will send my heart racing and my mind goes blank and all the hateful words come flooding back in. I had a dream where my current partners face transformed into my abusers face. That image has stuck with me and I don’t want it to continue to haunt me because I really love my current human and I don’t want to ruin this.   Any time I have a ptsd flashback, he tries to not aggravate it by being reactive, but he’s not perfect. He will let me cool off and then calmly approach me and will hold me so I don’t feel alone and scared. It takes me about 30 minutes to bounce back from the flashbacks and it is always followed by extreme remorse. I pulled my knife out on him once in one of these panic blackouts. I feel guilty for putting my pain into his words. Because he doesn’t use those words to hurt me. I would run if he wasn’t kind. He’s the kindest man I’ve ever loved and I know he is patient with me but I don’t want him to lose him because of my own misinterpretations.   I need resources for healing that I can read and listen to. I have health insurance and might be able to get mental health services covered, but I just don’t know where to start. I have heard about hypno therapy, and my brother has talked to me about exposure therapy, but I haven’t looked into anything more. I am reaching out before it’s too late, because I really really don’t want to be so hateful to myself anymore. I don’t want to hear my abusers voice in my head, And I really don’t want to project my pain onto my partner anymore.

2762,MentalHealthSupport,"PTSD, Limited perso disorder.. in crisis. What to do",JS__SRN,2,"Hi, we are nursing students who were displaced from clinical due to COVID-19. We have been approved by the Board of Registered Nursing to discuss health-related issues with the online community. We have found the following information to answer your post relating to PTSD and Personality disorder. We are working under the supervision of our instructor, however, the education we give is not to replace that of your primary care physician.  In your post, you had mentioned that after talking to your ex about one of your children, it had triggered your PTSD. Being able to recognize this as a trigger is a good start. You also mentioned that sometimes listening to music helps you but was not helping you this time. You stated that the tools your “psy” gave you were fairly new and you often forget them so we would like to take this opportunity to give you some information on different ways to cope with your PTSD. Living with PTSD can feel overwhelming and distressing, here are some things that you can do that might help:    * **Focus on your breathing.** Concentrate on breathing slowly in and out while counting to five. * **Carry an object that reminds you of the present.** Some people find it helpful to touch or look at a particular object during a flashback. * **Tell yourself that you are safe.** It may help to tell yourself that the trauma is over and you are safe now. It can be hard to think in this way during a flashback, so it could help to write down or record some useful phrases at a time when you're feeling better. * **Comfort yourself**. For example, you could curl up in a blanket, cuddle a pet, listen to soothing music or watch a favourite film. * **Keep a diary**. Making a note of what happens when you have a flashback could help you spot patterns in what triggers these experiences for you. You might also learn to notice early signs that they are beginning to happen. * **Try grounding techniques**. Grounding techniques can keep you connected to the present and help you cope with flashbacks or intrusive thoughts. For example, you could describe your surroundings out loud or count objects of a particular type or colour. (Self-care for PTSD., 2018)  Many treatments for personality disorders emphasize the importance of establishing coping techniques that work for you in order to better manage your emotions when they arise. Some techniques that can help cope with personality disorders can be building confidence to handle and tackle difficult situations, improving the ability to function under stressful circumstances, reducing harmful behaviors that can cause emotional distress to self and others, and reducing emotional dysregulation experiences. These techniques can help reduce and improve the ability to function and help manage emotions differently.   If you are feeling overwhelmed, it can help to try to focus on one feeling at a time. Remember that everyone is different and some methods will work better for some than it will for others. Over time you will be able to develop a better sense of what works for you and know the best ways for you to cope with your feelings in that moment.   We are not medical doctors. Please follow the advice of your Primary Care Physician. We can answer questions, but our information does not replace what your Primary Care Physician has stated. Please let us know how you are doing and stay safe.  **References**  Kristalyn Salters-Pedneault, P. (2020, February 28). Healthy Coping Skills for People With Borderline Personality Disorder.

3076,MentalHealthSupport,im really scared of myself,Actual-pianist,2,"There is nothing fundamentally wrong with you.  Google ""Intrusive Thoughts"". Many people have them, but paired with low impulse control they can become a problem. They grow stronger from acting based on them, even if the action is meant to prevent an outburst.  You are clearly very reflective and aware of the issue, that means you are doing a lot of things right. Mindfulness meditation might be gold for you. It can help you observe thoughts without judgement and without judging yourself for having them. This way you can let them go, without holding on to them.  You can also use repetitive simple activities in order to increase your focus and control over your thoughts. This is one of the reasons why Buddhists recite mantras and count mala beads. The repetitive task helps them let go of their inner processes.  There is also a potential underlying issue. Anger is mainly a defense mechanism, that is activated if people cross your boundaries. Was there an event in your early childhood where this happened, but where you were completely helpless? This event could have potentially set your entire body and mind into a long-term defense mode. ""Never be helpless again, never be weak again, always react quickly, faster, stronger ....""  When you get to the roots of your survival mechanisms and how they developed in childhood, in combination with mindfulness meditation you can tackle this thing longterm.

3238,MentalHealthSupport,My mental health is degrading and I don’t know who else to tell my problems to,Zelda_person,1,"My mental health has been degrading so I’m going to post about it on reddit because I’m too scared to talk to my parents and I’m too stubborn to go to therapy.  First problem: panic attacks. I get varying degrees of panic attacks on a daily basis. Usually it’s just random flashes of panic and my head basically feeling like it’s exploding. But some of them get bad I feel like my limbs are being ripped off and there’s screaming in my head. I can’t stop shaking and I barely remember anything after the fact. I don’t know how to stop them and any random thing can trigger them meaning I can’t avoid things that make me panic.   Second problem: self harm. I occasionally experiment with self harm. I have really bad anger management issues and I usually take my anger out in the form of stabbing cardboard boxes aggressively but sometimes I go for my skin. I think part of me feels like I deserve it and that’s why I keep going back to it. Part of me wants to stop and part of me wants to keep doing it.  Third problem: emotions. As I mentioned before I have bad anger issues. But I often feel strong surges of emotions like anger and sadness. And it’s not just oh I get sad and cry for a bit when a sad thing happens. These surges happen randomly and they get so bad where I have suicidal thoughts because I don’t want to feel anymore. I get so angry I want the knife in the boxes to be in my chest. I get so sad that the feeling of my heart being ripped out of my chest needs to be real. I avoid any sort of emotional situations because of this and I can’t handle anything sad.   Some other things: I get anxiety, not diagnosed, but I often get really bad anxiety usually social anxiety. It’s hard to handle. I think one of the reasons I refuse to go to therapy is I often get thoughts of “oh I’m only like this for attention. I’m not self harming because of anger, it’s because you want *cool scars* on your leg.” I don’t want to be that dipass who makes mental health a “trend” so I don’t seek help.
