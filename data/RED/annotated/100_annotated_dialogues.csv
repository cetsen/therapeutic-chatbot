618,MentalHealthSupport,Anyone else frustrated by this?,RoseBunny8,1,"So I posted yesterday that I'm in a relapse of my depression. Today was a lot better than yesterday, which is good.   I'm just wondering if anyone else gets frustrated when people/friends say something to the effect of ""oh I understand needing mental health days"" or ""I've been depressed sometimes too""?  Like I get theyre trying to be helpful and relate to me but having life long depression where every day your fighting your own brain is not the same as needing a ""mental health day"".   Yes I'm doing better today, but better here does not mean I'm all good and everything is solved. It means that I'm having a relatively good day where I can stay awake for more than an hour at a time and it doesnt feeling like every waking moment my brain is not telling me to kill myself or how much I suck.   How does everyone else respond to these well meaning ""I get it"" messages when you really feel like they don't? Do you just smile and nod or try to help them truly understand?",0.9436,positive,joyful,1,1

1340,MentalHealthSupport,I have to keep myself busy to not get sad but the stress from not relaxing is taking a toll on me.,TerryCrewsLovesYaoi,1,"Im 18 and currently in highschool. I enjoy it but it's tough so I study a lot at home in order to keep my grades up.I also work part time at a fast food restaurant and I'm currently in training to become a manager which is very exciting and would be great to have on my resume so I'm working very hard. Often 25-35 hour weeks. There are also a bunch of tests and things that I have to do at home in order to become a verified manager so my days are usually packed.  I'm also doing what I can to finish homework and get passing grades in school. I promised myself before I took the job a year ago that I can't let it get in the way of my education.  Over all I work and study for a total of 70-90 hours every week and have done so for a few months (not counting the summer ofc). I have fun at work and school and I finish things in time but I have noticed myself becoming tired, sad and stressed whenever I have free time. I also fear I'm no longer fun to be with because of my lack of energy and whenever I'm in social situations outside of school and work, I become tired and sorta quite fast. Whenever I'm by myself watching TV or playing video games or whatever I do to relax, I get anxiety and become super stressed. This started happening a few months ago but it's been gradually becoming worse.  Whenever I actually get an opportunity to relax, I feel myself becoming stressed and sad so I find something else to do. I'm now always trying to keep myself busy in order to not get anxious but not taking the time to sleep and relax is obviously making the stress worse.  I feel like I'm in a bad loop where I have to keep myself busy all the time but I'm stressed out over not having enough time to relax.  I haven't talked to anybody about this. Any advice is appreciated!  Thank you.",0.5572,positive,anticipating,1,1

1048,MentalHealthSupport,I'm getting a bit worried,ChocoMilk996,1,"Hello, everyone. Is it normal for me to pick at my skin multiple times a day? I have acne and I can't get my hands off my face or even the rest of my body. I pick at my scabs to the point of drawing blood sometimes and it's strange but oddly satisfying in a way. It's caused me a lot of scarring and I think it only makes the picking worse. I had a similar habit in the past as a kid when I would pluck out my hair and eyelashes, but I eventually controlled those urges. I find that playing games keeps my hands occupied but not for long.

1048,MentalHealthSupport,I'm getting a bit worried,hpnerd2,2,"Hello! It may just be a bad habit, but there’s also a name for a mental illness for this. (I’m a psych major so I’ve studied it before in college). The name of it is Excoriation disorder. It may help to research it. BUT if it is just a habit, I’ve had it as one (never the disorder). For me, I had to self examine to see why I was doing it. I learned it as a coping skill when my anxiety got too much. Whenever I noticed it happening, I told myself to stop. Over time, it got easier. I tended to do it on my arms and fingers so I wear longer sleeves and paint my nails really nice too. So for your face, you could try makeup or just being proud of a really good skin routine.

670,MentalHealthSupport,Pyromania?..,_HiddenMask_,1,"I have recently spoken to a phsyciatrist (forced :) about these issues and he recommended admitting me into a hospital out of safety reasons. Of course because of pricing being high we couldn't really say no or yes until we're sure it's absolutely necessary.   So lately for the past what.. About a month or two? I've been using fire as an outlet. Burning things began with candles and went onto paper, then notebooks, and now books as large as dictionaries. I won't really go into detail on emotions during the moments, but I know it helps. Sometimes it's difficult to hold back heavy urges to burn myself or others. Though holding back didn't work very long and I now have marks from either dripping hot wax onto myself or holding my hand above flames.   My mother and friends have called me names because of it..

I’ve been getting low grades no matter how hard I try, I suffering from limitations. To make it worse I spend most of my time by myself at school and kept up in the solitude of my room. And yeah it’s lonely, I’m an introvert but I’m just so damn lonely. I know that I have a girlfriend who loves me but why isn’t she here when I need her the most. I don’t blame her I just wish I could just let her know, if I do, I don’t know if she’ll listen or care and that’s what I’m scared about. That’s why I can’t message her. I’m scared even more because if I’m not open with communication in my relationship I risk losing her. I don’t know what to do I’m lost (mentally) and im scared and yet again I have no one to talk to. I don’t want to have another depressive season, it’s one of the most important years, year 12, for me. It reflects my future career.

They don’t tell you about all the 3am breakdowns you’ll endure, or how everything seems worse at night. They tell you, you may loose your appetite. They don’t tell you about the days that you don’t even have the energy to eat, or how sick food can make you feel. They tell you, you’ll be tired sometimes. They don’t tell you how it doesn’t matter how much you sleep you’ll always feel exhausted, or that some days you’ll be so tired even brushing your hair is a mountain to climb. They tell you, you may become distant from others. They don’t tell you it’s because you feel unworthy enough to enjoy the company of others, or how sometimes you just can’t face the world. They tell you, you might feel the need to harm yourself. They don’t tell you about the shame you feel as you purposely hurt your body, or the need to have some control over your life as it spirals - even if that way is inflicting pain.

The only thing that seems to work these days is sticking on YouTube or an audiobook and shutting my eyes. The talking makes my mind listen, and if it's something I've seen/heard a million times before, it knocks me out within an hour or two, which is practically miraculous for me. I'm not a professional, or any kind of sleep expert, just someone who suffers with severe intrusive thoughts.

398,MentalHealthSupport,Ovwhelmed and lack of motivation,fake_zealer,1,"I have a lot going on in my life. I'm 17 years old and I'm currently in foster care. I just got admitted to university this past week, I'm struggling with a couple of my highschool classes, and I'm dealing with the trauma of my past. (You gotta be in foster care for a reason.)   I've been in foster care for over a while (it'll be a year in march) and I say I've been handling things pretty well. I have only had less than a handful of instances where I broke down and cried.   But since I got admitted into university all of that has pretty much changed. I've been hit full on in the face with reality and its super hard. I've found that I have no real motivation for life other than ensuring my future happens. It's hard for me to get homework done and for me to keep trudging on.   I've just been so overwhelmed that I'm really depressed and have been feeling suicidal. I'm barely holding onto my sanity by a mere few threads.   Like just tonight, I had finished cooking dinner for my family and I sat down to eat. I had my headphones on and was watching youtube. But my foster mom a few feet away was shrillingily talking super loud. She just wouldn't shut up and it just sent me over the brim. (Plus my younger sister was just super sassy with me.) I ended up rushing up the stairs only to cry my eyes out, totally freaked out.  Normally shit like that wouldn't upset me but the noise just totally overwhelmed me.  I have a good relationship with my foster parents and I'm normally super open to talking with them, but I'm scared to mention the suicidal part to my foster parents because that is taken super seriously.   I just don't know what to do. I'm currently in therapy but its biweekly and doesn't do much. Does anyone have any advice for finding motivation as well as helping with the overwhelming feeling?

7945,Anxietyhelp,[13] fit teen. Weird sensation when surprised or excited.,Fluffy_Charge_59,1,Hey I’ve been having anxiety for a while ever since qurantine started. It started when I was lying down weird and I felt something drop in my throat. It ended up being silent reflux. And I’ve been taking a powdered  ant acid that I put in water  however I’ve been kinda slacking since I don’t take it everyday. I’m on and off about it because I still have some days to go with it but it’s pretty much fixed. It did come back once but I took the medicine again and after a day of taking it and drinking water it went away again.  Then I started getting ringing in the ears but that was due to anxiety too because once I stopped getting stressed about it it went away     But with this. Even after I’m not being stressed about it it can randomly hit me. Idk maybe it’s because when I get excited sometimes I think about it while I’m still excited or surprised and it hits quick. Making me think it just randomly happened. But yea I’ve spoken to some online doctor and he also said it was anxiety. It usually happens the most at night when I’m very sleepy. That’s why I’ve been trying to go to sleep before I get insanely sleepy or else I will get those panic attacks which give me those sensations.ive also been getting the skipping of heart feeling too sometimes. My parents said that’s normal as well but it’s been happening a lot. It didn’t happen that much today until I got stressed again.   I’m pretty much 100% that it’s anxiety because all this time I was relaxed it barely happened and when it did I was sure it was from post anxiety still trying to heal. And again it only happens a lot when I’m stressed not much when I’m relaxed.  Plus I’m on my 13 and I’m in shape. I guess I’m just looking for these comments to ease it.     Also question. Can doing something intense cause chest pain or aching? Because before I did that intense thing my chest wasn’t getting a zap and wasn’t having slight pain. I just don’t want this to build up. And I really don’t want to get on medications or therapy because every time I’ve had anxiety of some sort I’ve fixed it myself or my family fixed it. The zap feeling is probably the least common of them I think it only happened 2 times.  But the slight pain doesn’t even hurt that much hurts less than a pinch.

4085,Anxietyhelp,How should I set up my own boundaries to friends who have depression too and want to vent?,Spiderbendy,1,"I love my friends so dearly but I’m now working on myself in therapy and learning CBT so I finally was honest with myself.   I wear myself thin. I get borderline anxiety any time they vent to me, because more often than not, I am not equipped to help them. I can listen but I don’t know how to give advice or even what Comfort Words ™ to say. But I’ve heard/seen that in order to be a good friend, you have to be there for their highs and lows. So I figured I Had to be available for them to vent anytime they needed? But I get into this mode of “I Have To Help Them” regardless of how I immediately stress out since I know one wrong word can make them feel worse or I could give them bad advice.   I suppose I need to be working on myself to be able to be there for friends, cuz it’s not their fault I stress myself by over thinking.   So I think my overall question is, what is a healthy friendship? Should I be putting up such a harsh boundary of Never venting to me? (*My mother forces me to hear her vents 24/7 so it wears me down, then to add my friends who are in way more difficult situations, makes me feel almost responsible for them too*)  Have any of you had this experience?",0.9229999999999999,positive,anxious,1,1
4085,Anxietyhelp,How should I set up my own boundaries to friends who have depression too and want to vent?,abuffalonickle,2,"Oh love, your heart is in the right place, but that place is how we got here. And I say “we” because I am the same way. It is in fact the healthiest of relationships that are honest. It’s hard to tell your friends you have nothing left in the tank to give cause you’re barely hanging on yourself. Truly hard. Because we are the “strong” ones. And at least for me, I held myself to that standard always.... until I broke. Doesn’t make you any less strong, doesn’t make you weak, but it does make you HUMAN! None of us can carry everyone’s loads, and it’s not fair to tell yourself you can and if these people are your friends they will understand. Vulnerability is hard, but that conversation will relieve you of a “responsibility” that truly isn’t yours alone. Be honest. With your friends and most importantly yourself. You can’t do it all, all the time my friend. 10/10 your friends want you at your best, and if they understood how you felt they would get it. You are human, and you are loved for being that.

I've been here a year basically I'm having horrible work anxiety to the point where I'm having trouble getting out of bed. As I'm laying here at 10:45 am,  I have work at 2 and it's seriously affecting my mental health at this point  Back story  We sell shoes of course, my shift is from 2-7,today and tomorrow Yesterday I felt the same and had to convince myself not to ghost my job or call out It doesn't pay well. 10$ an hour, my checks are about 5.% of my actual money, but we do have a 50% discount which is great  At this point, that's all I want. I'm not passionate about the work  I get uncomfortable here for a number of reasons: The temperature is very cold, low 60s always, my body temp gets confused. I get hot/cold for hours and can't control it Poor scheduling I've tried to change my availability and nobody has listened to me My manager is nice but on her terms, I don't think she will give a fuck about my mental health and will fire me if I cant work at 100% for any reason They are very concerned with performance but don't communicate well  Vibe of the store is very depressing to me I'm now so anxious it's making me physically sick  and I'm not allowed to switch shifts with people!    I feel so hurt and guilty, yesterday I was an emotional mess inside and couldn't work fully. I was late by half hour, scared to walk into work,icouldn't focus on the register and I created a long line by accident,luckily my one manager cares about me and let me go home an hour early.  We are understaffed because vans hates to hire new people and its so much pressure when really its not paying us much at all.   My other jobs i can work on my own time, and I'm waiting to start a new job in the cannabis dispensary..  My family and friends love my discount and I do love being able to get shoes but I feel I can't do this anymore  What do I do?

I am a Psychology student and the dissertation is on the effect sleep disturbances on mental health (including anxiety, depression and suicidal behaviours).   There is a mass of evidence showing how taking part in studies on mental health is beneficial for those who are suffering (Gibson, Boden, Benson, &amp; Brand, 2014, Wong, Kwok, Michel, &amp; Wong, 2017), it has also been seen to greatly reduce suicidal ideation.

I was happy  I thought everything will be back to normal, however since then he keeps going with my other friends and they never call me if they go out, it became that my friends only answer me if I call them and they never call me, I keep getting anxious non stop that I am out of the group and that my friend is trying to seperate me. I became so anxious I cannot sleep many times and I feel my heartbeat becoming fast for a long period of time.

6822,depressed,Self isolation has got me down...,Darkerfaerie,2,Have you talked to your boyfriend about it? Is he willing to help you motivate yourself so you can start getting back on track?   One thing that helps me get out of bed when my husband is home is when he tells me he wants to be with me but that he won't come to bed. Its endearing and helps motivate me to get my ass out of bed.   Try to find some reason to do things. And dont worry about how much or how big it is.

I feel like I'm behind a mask and I just smile and look pretty just so that I can get through a conversation. I want to show my emotions here and not be judged.  I'm a Junior in high school and I now have 2 weeks off. I'm attracted to this girl in my English class and I'm worried that I'm never going to see her again. I never really talked to her and she never really talked to me. I don't want to miss a chance to get to know her. There's no real solution now and I've thought of everything.  My school friends are not helping either. I feel like they are slowly drifting away. Most of my friends I originally made in 8th grade are either gone, or have broken off due to disagreements. My only two remaining friends are slowly drifting away. One of them is no longer in school most of the time due to social issues and my other friend now spends most of his time with his girlfriend. I'm not blaming them for their social issues or having a girlfriend, I just feel like I'm being spoiled by saying that my friends are starting to not care about me.  I just want to lie on the ground and breathe right now. I don't want my life to get cut short just because of a few shitty moments. I want to go back to 8th grade when responsibilities like applying for college and driving weren't there and my friend group was actually there for me. This is the first time I've felt depressed and it really started hitting me hard in January and it's been on and off ever since.  I don't want to invite friends over because then it feels like a chore to talk and not just do my own thing. I can't make new friends now because I'm trapped in my house. I just want someone who can be there for me (and I can be there for them).

The past 3 years were getting slowly better. Everything the past 6 months have been fantastic! Up and coming me and the lady's 3rd year, school going better, finally losing weight, everything just felt better. Then... since the last 2 weeks have been shitty. I can see it when she talks to me she's disinterested. Hasn't texted me in those 2 weeks, along with her seeming distant since Valentine's Day, but I didn't wanna believe it. School has been getting harder since people don't seem interested in talking to me. Not even the one teacher who enjoyed my company. Both my parents enjoy the company of my sisters better since they got kids. They don't talk with me ever anymore. Everything feels like it's falling apart and I feel like I did something wrong. 2nd night of sleeping alone and I hate it. That pain in my gut of being alone has come back and I hate it. I look in the mirror and I hate it. I think she might be ready to leave me. Everyone else has lost faith in me or has dropped any sort of relationship so why stick around me? I've been staring at my gun the past few nights waiting for her to tell me she's leaving. Wake up to either a note in my room or a text. I'm about to lose everything and I just want to cry and end it because it feels like I somehow fucked everything up with family and friends and I don't wanna be alone again with nothing. I attempted suicide a few months before meeting her. Ever since I had her in my life I never wanted to. I feel like if she leaves and that connection is gone I might just snap.

5368,depressed,I'm done with my family and can't bear them anymore,sorter_plainview,1,"It's been a year and half since I diagnosed with depression. When I look back now those days were horrible and I wonder how did I survive.   I was an active person during my undergrad. Being part of organising events and publications, was something I really enjoyed and did with complete dedication. The first year of masters was quiet compared to the undergrad, but in the second year, I started to be active again. It was by the last months of master, I was diagnosed with depression.   I'm from a developing country and here culture keeps family at a high position. A lot of compromise happen to keep the family from splitting. Things like moving out isn't that easy, because the culture is not in the same way as in developed countries. We are obliged to make compromises in the name of family. Also please bear any mistakes in my language.     Looking back I don't know from which point the life went out of control. I wasn't sleeping properly. I would stay up until like 4 am or 5 am, then I will sleep till noon. I barely ate, and whenever I ate it was unhealthy food in huge quantity. That is when I started to gain weight. What did I lack? May be happiness. Or care from someone. Or some respect from my family. Or a supportive gesture from a stranger.   Life was always difficult. I was sexually abused as a child. It happend for years before somehow I managed to stop it. My abuser is a close relative, who I see still today. I don't talk to him. But his presence makes me upset. My palms get sweaty and I usually walk away. That same abuser made an attempt towards my sister and she managed to avoid it. What cringe me the most is that, my parents still talk to him even after knowing he made an attempt towards my sister. They still believe the family need to be kept intact. They didn't know, until recently that he sexually abused me for a long time.  I didn't open up to my family about the sexual abuse until very recently just, because I don't want to make them sad. I thought I can bear them all. All my personal problems and all the family problems. Everything. I was wrong. I was dead wrong. I always adjusted for others, always for my family, and always put myself, or my heath or my happiness, in the second position. Never in my life I cared about me. I was always the one who can take all the pressure. In every family dispute I stood in the middle, I stayed and invested a lot of my time and energy to set things straight. In the end, when I was down, I had no one to take care of me or support me. Literally no one. Because I was the tough the one.  Did my family support me? Yes, financially. Nothing else. They kept on blaming me for the things I failed to do, events I failed to attend, and the disputes I failed to solve. They blamed me for my failure. Never they considered my side. Never they asked how am I doing now. Never they asked about my health or happiness or my situation. Even after I was diagnosed with depression the support was never there. They don't ask how am I doing now.   Few months back I landed on a very small job. I have been struggling to pull myself together for all these days. Since, the job I got was near to my grandmother's place, I was staying with her. The salary I get is very low. If I convert it to USD, it is around 169 USD per month. Mainly I stayed with my grandma, because of this. She is a bad woman. Hate is her characteristic and she makes the life difficult of people living with her. After a month or so, my father asked me to move out, because grandmother didn't want me around. He didn't consider whether I'm in a position to hold on by myself if I move out, both financially and mentally. I opted for a accommodation provided by my employer, which is more like a Hostel kind of setup. I have been living here since then.   I was deeply hurt by the lack of empathy from my family. They take me for granted. They call me whenever they have a need. Only sister call me to just check on me. I do understand, that many people don't know how to deal with mental health issues. So, when I was asked to move out I wanted to explain my situation to them. I wanted to talk about the sexual abuse I faced and how their attitude of preventing a conflict, shifts the load to my head. But I couldn't open my mouth. I still don't know how to explain all this. So I wrote a 15 page letter to my family and passed it to each of them. Everyone read it. What broke me completely is that they didn't even discuss a word about it. Not even an acknowledgement. I was literally done at that point. For all those things I did for them, I got back only complaints about the things I failed to do.   I really don't know how to deal with them. It is difficult to cut the ties. Im kind of done with them. But, honestly, deep down I still love them. I don't know why. But that is what I feel about them.   Medically speaking my doctor stopped anti depressants few months back. But I struggled to make my sleeping pattern normal. In the past few weeks, I could feel I was going down the spiral again. The same old habits are creeping in and I can't get anywhere near to productive. Two weeks back doctor prescribed the antidepressants again. But my biological rhythm is so fucked that I can't get anything done. I'm sleeping till noon and barely going to work.  I don't think I can hold on by on my own anymore. I was even suicidal during my peak depression days. I had high urge to jump off from heights or moving vehicles. I somehow resisted it because there is always something left to do, to improve. I always wanted to make the lives of people better. I work a lot for that. With one more episode of depression, I really doubt if I will survive. I don't see much left to do now. Life is getting meaningless everyday.  TL;DR: My family don't understand my situation and blames me for the things I failed to do. I can't bear them anymore.

I guess I'm just lonely, and just for anyone to read this would be enough..  I'm honestly holding back tears as i write this. O don't usually give in to being this sad, it just feels like my life has been one long road. I think on how every road comes to an end, so my question becomes.. Do i want it to end?  As by my name if you couldn't tell, it's a gamertag. I love games. Games are my escape from this world, when im in my room alone, in the dark just playing. I don't think about the past anymore, just hurts too much. The pain, i can't control.  I lost my brother 8 years ago, he was my big brother.. A year later my suppose to be dad who didn't really care to be one, died as well.  Now i only have my mom, and she has a disease known as lupus. Autoimmune. Her body destroys itself, she's worked hard and if i could i would take her sickness and die.   Were struggling with bills. The medicine she gets cost a lot, and my work doesn't make enough, however.. Im getting sick as well, doctors say it's hard to diagnose. My mother went undiagnosed until around 28 when she nearly died from her sickness.  She went through mutiple life threatening surgeries, and even doctors are surprised she's lived this long. I'm starting to feel the pressure.  Recently me and my mom helped my grandfather through hospice. We made him comfortable, and stayed by his side as they took him off everything. It was so overwhelming. I didn't want to be there so badly but i promised myself. If anyone i love is dying, I'm going to put on a show. Make them feel comfortable, loved, and show them the conviction in my eyes that everything will be okay. I did that.. I cried in my room, then i would watch motivation videos and work out, shower. Then i would watch him until the sun set. What hurt the most.. After a while they stop opening their eyes, talking, but they move their fingers letting you know theyre listening..fuck. I'm hurting so much inside. So on the last day.. I held his hand and i was crying but i tried to sound so confident. I said"" Everything will be okay grandpa, god is watching over you, there is no darkness, only a warm light around you while our loved ones watch. You're not alone, and like i promised. I'll always be by your side."" It was 6 in the morning. The sun was rising. Surprisingly sunday. I got up and opened the blinds, i told him"" I can tell today is going to be a good day (he would always ask and admire nature outside), the sun is shining and it has a cool breeze."" I laid my hand on his head, and i noticed his breathing became less.  His breaths, longer pauses than before. Finally, he didn't breath again and i waited 3 long minutes. I broke down so hard.. I went to my room and i couldn't stop crying. I thought why is life like this, we grew up poor, and I've lost so much already.  Then i had to be strong as they came for his body, and so came the funeral which we couldn't even pay, so we had to cremate his body. I dont know if thats how you spell it. We didnt have money to bury him next to my grandma and uncles...  Now my mom is all i have left and she's getting sicker, and i am too. My symptoms have worsened. Doctors think i inherited an autoimmune disease also. I can barely pay for her medicine and my body is failing me. We live in some crappy apartments, if its not my body tearing me down, its my mind from the inside. One or the other. I don't let her see these emotions, she has it rough already. I actually pawned my ps4 to give her a good birthday, so i don't have any games to play but i still come here to talk about games. There's so much more that aches me, but it's too much to write. I'll most likely delete this post soon.. In situations that people break down in, scared or just can't handle the emotions. I stand stern and calm. My family asks me how im able to withstand it. I tell them you have to have conviction in what you believe and feel emotions later. Emotions cloud judgement in dangerous situations. The part i never tell them.. Is that my view of the world is dark, and im completely stressed out, i avoid thinking of the past because ill break, i lost most of my talking skills so i dont have any friends, how im haunted by my life events, how even sometimes i want to die.. Does my voice get through..  Its okay if im lonely, dont have friends, money, i just wanted to live peacefully with the ones i love the most. They're all leaving me, soon ill be alone.  What will this life be worth without them by my side.. I pray god takes me after my mom goes, i dont think i want to live any longer. The pain is too much to endure and the sickness is eating me alive and i cant breathe, im reaching my limits!  Okay, im going to stop now.. I cant even cry for long, This is just a partial stort of my life, one that will ultimately fade because life continues forward.. I know were all faces our challenges. I wish all of you the best out there..",0.9356,positive,anxious

I've talked to my professors for advice and they all told me that I should just focus on my studies first (since I study in the top uni in my country) and that the tuition is free so I don't need to work anyway. I have quite a shallow reason for wanting to have a job - it's because I want to buy myself stuff with my own money.   I am a scholar and so I receive bi-annually stipend. But money just disappears so easily! I spend it mostly for transportation (dorm would be even more expensive), for buying food for my mom, dad, and sister to eat out in fancy places, as a treat, and I also like buying a couple of clothes every now and then as a treat for myself for working my ass off even though I have really bad mental health without getting treatment because I simply can't even afford consulting a psychiatrist about it. And I knew that even if I could afford consulting a doctor, I know the meds would be really expensive.   Right now I can't even fix my life because I'm too poor to go out with people and literally don't have time to date / hang out with people because I spend 3 hours traveling daily and I spend practically all day at university. I don't have time anymore. As I've said I study in a top uni and so the workload here is pretty hellish.

If I settled for honors classes and just one club, so that way I could still have fun.

I'm have bipolar disorder which I've been dealing with for the past 10 years and recently I stopped smoking weed and going to group therapy.. I'm taking my meds and going to group three times a week. I feel like I'm trying to keep myself busy and be patient... ugh I hate that phrase... but I still feel in the fog. I'm worried I'm ruining my marriage to a man who is nothing but supportive and I feel like I'm always going to feel like I'm living in black and white. like nothing is satisfying, like I'm looking at the world through a cage and don't know how to get out. I've been suicidal in the past but never really wanting to die, just terrified of forever being stuck in this mundane and depressed existence..

569,depression_help,Not sure if I should go back to therapy/a doctor,koicartel,1.0,"So bit of an overview; I'm 17 years old right now but I've been struggling with depression since I was around 11. I developed anorexia nervosa at the age of 14 and that + worsening depression culminated in 5 weeks in an intensive adolescent psych ward following a suicide attempt when I was 15.  I'm weight restored and though I still struggle with frequent ED-related thoughts, I'm a lot better than I used to be and I'm doing ok at keeping things together in that respect.  I was initially put on fluoxetine for the depression, then sertraline after fluoxetine didn't work. Sertraline fucked with me a lot and made me way more suicidal, so I was quickly switched to citalopram and quetiapine (which helps me sleep, though isn't working so much anymore because I've been taking it every night for quite a while).    I broke off a toxic relationship just over a year ago which made things a lot brighter and between then and now things have been ok 95% of the time; I won a scholarship to spend a month touring around Germany, I've been riding and racing motorcycles which I love, and spending lots of time with all my friends, whom I adore. I'm moving to Germany in January, first to work as an au pair and then to study, my grades are really good, and objectively everything in my life is great, but I struggle a lot (and even more so recently) with finding a reason in living.  I constantly ask myself what the point of life is at all, if I will ever have some kind of significant role in life, why I'm even bothering to do anything when life is so temporary and we all just end up forgotten at the end of it anyway. Sure there's finding a rewarding career and stuff like that but everything feels so monotonous to me; I just finished 13 years of school, I'm going to be doing 6+ years at university and then however many years at work until I retire and just wait around til I die. I have very little motivation to do anything and I'm finding myself consumed more and more by envy of other people and their successes, wanting to find my own drive and passion in- and for- life again.   I'm not sure if this is depression coming back or just a bit of an existential crisis, but everything seems pretty bleak at the moment. I'm hesitant to see a psychologist, counsellor etc since that would involve telling my parents about all this, and they didn't take things very well last time I was in this kind of state, + with the hospital and everything. I know they want to help but the way they respond to this kind of thing is and was so distressing, and I also don't want them to start thinking that I shouldn't go to Germany since that's my main beacon of hope.   I really don't know what to do at the moment; do I just try to wait all this out til I get to Germany and hope that everything rights itself there or do I try and address it now in case it gets worse? I feel like I'm rotting   **tl;dr- been depressed since I was 11, tried to kms when I was 15 (now 17), things were ok since around last july/august to now but recently I feel like I've developed into an edgy tumblr nihilist and I'm struggling to find any kind of motivation or meaning in life at all. I'm a little reluctant to see a psych/counsellor because my parents get real spooked and tend to flip out, and I'm not sure if moving to Germany in January (which has been my dream for ages) will make everything better on its own or if I should try address this now in case it gets worse and I fuck over my chances.** ",0.9228,positive,lonely,1,1

9854,depression_help,Left wondering,myrrh2,1.0,"This may be a long post lol. Anyways I am a pretty young guy 23 years old and is currently enlisted in the armed forces. My girlfriend and I recently broke up and it honestly crushed my soul, we were dating for 5 months long distance(with a few instances where we were physically together) but I've known her for around 5.  She has dealt with depression for a long time and I have known based on the stories she has told me but it didn't stop me from loving the hell out of her. She would say she's crazy but I would see how amazing she really was. Of course there were some disagreements and we had some arguments but it never made me think, ""Damn she really is crazy""! Honestly those 5 months of being with her were the absolute best months of my life, she is so caring and affectionate, she has shown me so much adventure and great times. We actually enjoyed each others company and we felt we could say anything to each other.  She told me in the first few weeks of dating me it already was deeper than her last year long relationship. In my honest opinion and the opinion of others her last boyfriends were complete assholes, and it feels weird to me that she would leave someone that actually cared deeply about her and would stay by her side in the toughest of times. But when I said that I was willing to stay with her and support her she said she did not want me to wait for her, if I stayed that it would cause her to feel resentment. She keeps repeatedly telling me that she caused me pain and that she cant talk to me because she cant deal with my pain and that she isn't that great of a person to hold onto in the first place; she wanted space. But she was the light of my life and it hurts when I read those words.  Now onto my side of the story I guess. Since I'm in the armed forces its already stressful enough and being long distance adds to the stress but I bare it because I love the hell out of this girl. I just don't feel as if I'm getting any better by being where I am right now. My body is banged up and I'm about to be medboarded out of the military which would be a blessing because I can then follow my dreams. I've been banged up for about a year now and even the medical staff thinks its best for me to get separated out.  I've been in limbo for awhile with this, I feel like I cant plan my future until I know I'm being medboarded (if I'm staying in the military or not) and its been stressing me out. I felt that if I was separated from the military that it would definitely benefit the relationship with my significant other since I would feel like I gained my freedom and manhood back. To not be burdened by all of the restrictions and restraints placed on me. This place really took its toll on me and I feel it leaked out into the relationship but I tried to make her understand how hard it is out here where I am stationed and on top of that not being able to perform my duties due to my broken body.  I wanted to talk to her because just the simple act of communicating with her made my day. Sometimes I felt as if I was somewhat neglected and that she was pushing me away, she realized that maybe sometimes she was being selfish, but I don't fault her for that anymore I understand where she is coming from. She would isolate herself due to the depression and push everyone away, but it was hard for me because I had no way of knowing she was feeling down until I would ask and wonder if she was ok. During the early stages of long distance it did get me down since I would just feel like shit when we didn't talk much during the day, and she thought I needed her to be happy but its just the fact that I wanted to chat sometimes. It got a lot better after awhile I realized I had to calm down and I did. There were a few times where I felt that she was misunderstanding me (which she did lol) and I would have to explain myself. I think these moments and mixed with depression and other things caused her to feel as if she was causing me pain all the time.  When she let me go she said she wanted me to be in a healthy and happier relationship but she doesn't understand that I am truly happy with her and Id do anything to stay with her and see to it that she gets the help that she wants! She keeps saying that she's not that great of a person anyways, that she was too hard on me sometimes and for me to just let go like this never happened. It fucking kills me inside. Id do anything for this girl because I'm just that type of person with anyone. She would tell me that time heals all wounds which it does but I don't like the fact that it sounds so permanent, its a decision she made thinking its the best for me but only I can decide what's best for me in the end. I'm not putting up with her depression and the pain that comes with it sometimes. I CHOOSE to, I've grown more understanding of it and tried to change myself to where I would just give her space, but I was still happy with her.  There were positives to the breakup and some negatives lol. I realized the love I have for myself and my goals. I was able to look at the relationship we had from a birds eye view for the first time. I realized that even though she was telling me to let her go because she was too harsh, I couldn't because I cant hate anyone especially her. Instead of hate I felt an even stronger sense of love and sense of caring for her, thinking back on all the memories we created while we were physically in each others presence, all of the deep conversations we have had, her amazing laugh and energy and it kills me to think she wants me to let go of that forever. I want to be by her side and text her that but I have to respect the space that she wants so she can work on herself. She said she was sorry for starting a relationship with me that she couldn't finish due to her problems. I wanted to be with her through thick and thin but she sees it as me just waiting around for her and she doesn't want me to do that. I just wish she could see into my mind to know how I felt about her still and that I want to be by her side to support her.  Do you think she will ever reach out to me and consider getting back together because this girl is a god damn angel to me and an inspiration, it just hurts that depression has taken its hold and I hope she gets better because she deserves to. It would hurt if she just forgot about me and just forgot about all the good times we did have. I miss this girl so much and love and care for her.

She’s emo and I wasn’t she wore all black and I was just a normal guy that has fun and had a great personality. While I was with her I had really good times and all I can do is remember those times. I can’t let go. One day we got into a big argument and I already knew what she was gonna do after we finished arguing so I told her don’t do it and she acted like I didn’t know but then I said don’t cut yourself and she promised she wouldn’t. The next day I see her I hug her and kiss her and apologized for how stupid I was being then I told her to let me see her arm and she said no so I pulled back her sleeve to see all these cuts. It felt like I got shot right in the chest. I felt so dumb because she cut herself because of me. I went home that day and started to burst out in tears and then I just grabbed a razor and did it myself. I realized from that day that I changed who I was I don’t see myself as a joyful guy anymore I just see myself as a pathetic waste of space and a waste of time. If I had her here today with me I wouldn’t need to cut I wouldn’t have depression but she’s gone. I still hold on to the hats she wore and gave to me. I still have our pictures together.

4576,depression_help,My depression,Calisso,2.0,"Please don't feel so bad about it! And please (!!) stop cutting yourself while you can.   It's not your fault that she cutted herself after your argument primary. She has, or had, a serious mental problem and that's not because of you. She took your trust and decided to throw it away, not you!  I bet she would have cutted herself in an argument with others too. It isn't nice to think about it that way but if you realise it, you will get over it. She was not ready to quit, there was nothing you could do about it 'cause in the first place, she has to want it.  Someday she will think about cutting herself and that there is a way and so will you! Compensate your anger and disappointment with sports, meditation, reading and talk about your feelings over and over. You will never forget what happened but you'll understand and learn from it.   As you said, there is a happy and nice person in you and it's still there! I am sure that one day there will be a girl that can appreciate you and doesn't manipulate you that way your ex did.

They go from bad to worse to anxiety attack back to bad again. I did try working as an Uber driver for a while. Kind of a terrible job for me since I'm not good with being around people.

8069,depression_help,Student in dire need for motivation,Aenarion21,1.0,"Hello. Like many others that come here, I need help. Or I think I need it. Or I need someone to tell me how to help myself.  &amp;#x200B;  I’m a student, 26 years old, currently working on my thesis (on human reliability analysis \[HRA\]) for my mechanical engineering degree. I really like this career. I have studied it for years, and though it hasn’t been easy, and I had some courses I really disliked, I passed every one of them. There were semesters where I spent most of my weekends at the university, where I didn’t see my friends for months and I slept like 2-hours most days; but I liked it there: the pressure, the difficult tests and all (mine is one of the top engineering universities in my country). After finishing my courses, I started working on a thesis about fluid mechanics and heat transfer, heavily focused on simulation of turbulent flow. I liked it. Before going for engineering, I thought about getting into science. And this felt like science, it was a cutting-edge investigation, heavily funded. But I couldn’t finish it. Suddenly, I didn’t have the structure of periodic test and a schedule to keep at uni. I had more “free” time that I knew what to do with it. But also, I started having problems with my thesis, specifically, I didn’t have the pc necessary to do the complicated simulations I needed to get my results. My Thesis Supervisor wanted to help but couldn’t get me the pc I needed, although he tried.  &amp;#x200B;  During this period, depression hit me hard, and I let this go on for several months. When I finally got myself to talk and tell everything to my Thesis Supervisor, I had already lost a year of my life. He understood completely, he was very supportive and kind, but I just couldn’t work on any thing related to fluid mechanics again, which was his area.  &amp;#x200B;  After that, and not long ago, I went to another professor, with whom I could be friends with (I think), if we weren’t student and professor and didn’t have so much age difference. Anyway, he understood what I went trough and offered me another thesis, on HRA, on which I’m currently working. This was a little before the holidays, and he encouraged me to travel or something, to clear my head. But now I’m back, and I must schedule a meeting with him soon.  &amp;#x200B;  Beside this, I have to tell you about my personal life. After a long while single, I have a girlfriend now, we have been together for some time and it’s going great. This relationship is my peace of mind and source of happiness. But my life at home isn’t great. We are not doing well on money and my parents fight a lot. They are also tidiness maniacs, which I’ve always hated. We have talked several times, and I know I’m not young, I should be working right now, and I think many of my mood problems would go away if I was living on my own, or with friends. But to do that, I need to finish my thesis, and I can’t find the will to do that. I thought the source of my depression was the hard times at university, and that it got worse when I couldn’t finish my previous thesis; but now, after I got another investigation topic and even after some great holidays with my girlfriend, I still can’t seem to find the will to do the research, to write about what I have read. Instead, I play some stupid game on my smartphone or watch series on Netflix. I don’t even like playing games too much or staying in bed until late, but still every time I try to work, I get sleepy, I play without really enjoying the game, or lose my time on memes or other web pages I don’t really care that much about anyway. Seems like anything goes before what I really have to do, but in my mind I’m all too conscious about what I have to do, yet it’s like I’m hitting an invisible wall every time I open my thesis.  &amp;#x200B;  First, I thought I would feel better when I got past the difficult courses at uni. Then I thought I would get better after changing my thesis. I thought I would feel better having a partner. Even when things with my family are perfect, I don’t feel so good.  I know this is not as bad as other people’s situation. I know I could be doing a lot worse, but I don’t need that right now. I need to find a way to motivate myself to read and to write.  &amp;#x200B;  I’m not sure what I came looking for here, but maybe I just needed to write this whole thing down and hope someone would understand and say something helpful. Or maybe just posting this post, will help me understand myself a little bit better.",0.998,positive,guilty,1,1
8069,depression_help,Student in dire need for motivation,gravity_grave_87,2.0,"Hi there.   Your post really resonated with me. I'm currently on a break from my PhD because I ended up with the exact same 'invisible wall' months ago, after going through a really rough time. I still can't check my e-mails without drinking a substantial amount which numbs the anxiety. I get nauseous every time I have to use my old USB stick because I can see my thesis-related files on there. Relationships-wise, my life is fine.   What you're describing and the closest word to what I have been experiencing is trauma. And I don't think it even needs to be PTSD levels of trauma to cause severe distress. Perhaps it's the frustration of going into your first project all wide-eyed and excited and ending up not completing it (for whatever reason). Perhaps it's something completely unrelated which you were struggling with and weren't aware of at the time. Plus there's the added pressure of your current home situation - I did feel a massive improvement when I moved out of my old flat, which I hated with a passion and only reminded me of really bad times.   Either way, are you seeing a therapist? Are they helping at all? If not, you should definitely consider it. Good luck x ",-0.9433,negative,grateful,1,1

I try to fill the void by doing activities like hiking and biking but lately that has not been enough. I lost a best friend to cancer and then my other best friend and girlfriend decided to have sex for a month behind my back before a mutual friend got drunk and told me. I moved away from home 3 years ago and I have made a lot of progress but I find myself to be more depressed, alone, and thinking about suicide now rather than 3 years ago when I felt like I hit rock bottom. I struggle so much in school, one of my jobs is very stressful and I constantly think, if I had a gun I would have ended things a while ago.

62188,SuicideWatch,[16M] Better to die when I want to than when I don't.,LiterallyBlue,2.0,"I can't pretend to know who you are, what are your life experiences and what you feel from just a couple of your posts. In that same way you will probably not be able to completely understand what I'm saying in my reply - the point I'm trying to make is that we are two strangers and we're discussing a very complex matters that are based in large part on our own past life.  In the end, what you do is always your choice. But here are couple of my thoughts that might change some parts of your perspective (if you find them valid, of course).  I believe you should be mostly focused on yourself. Worrying about things like what others do or think is pointless. The only thing you have control over is yourself. That's why you should do things you find enjoyable (for me that's videogames, watching movies, learning new stuff...). Even in a scenario in which life has no inherent meaning that doesn't mean you can't have fun. Or do things that you like. For me these are some of the reasons to keep living, even if just a little bit longer.  The only thing worth living for is yourself. I find it really stupid when some people are ""living for their children/partner/..."". If the fundametal reason of your life is dependent on a different person - what will you do if they leave you or if they get into some kind of accident? I believe that you can only have a real relationship with another person when you're both living for yourself, but because you both want to make your lives better you decide to be together. If that condition is not met the relationship is probably toxic and doomed to fail.  I have little to zero experience with gender issues and I'm not completely sure what you mean by identity issues so I may be completely off here but if you say: ""idgaf what others think, I'm going to like what I like"" and you learn to accept yourself for who you are those kind of issues are mostly solved (at least they were for me). If you don't like something about yourself you can always try to change it.  It really doesn't matter what job you have - if it's something that you like doing then great; if it's something boring/hard but you get paid enough to be able to do things you like in your free time - that's very good too; (on the other hand if you hate your job you should obviously quit). But as far as other people are concerned your job only gives then a reason to brag. Even if you were a CEO of whatever big company your life wouldn't be any better or worse than if you were selling bread at the supermarket, at least not in the aspects that matter. If you have enough money for basic stuff then it's more important to have a good mentality than a title and extra cash lying around. So saying that you won't ammount to anything is looking at yourself from others perspective but that doesn't matter at all. It's a lot more important what you think.  To answer this: &gt; So why shouldn't I take this opportunity, where I can die with no pain to myself and minimal pain to my friends and family?  I mean death is the necessary part of life - that's what a lot of people don't seem to get and then they're so surprised when it happens. You just need to accept that. But wouldn't it be great if you ever found someone you like to spend many years your life with? Would you really throw all that away just because you die at the end?

But I’m so sick and tired of being told I don’t do anything when I work over 40 hours a week on overnights at a gas station. It may seem like not much but I do it all I work overnight I work in the kitchen I work days I work doubles I do everything I can to make enough money to support the ones in my life. But it’s never enough. Everyday my boyfriend tells me how worthless I am and how lazy I am. When I try to talk back about it he gets mad and pulls my hair and yells in my ear and tells me I’m a liar. I always get hit in the head so I constantly have headaches and I’m always tired because I get yelled at if I sleep during the day. I just don’t know what to do. I do everything he tells me to do but somehow it’s always wrong. I love to sleep because I can escape this whole life and dream of better things. That’s why I want to die because then it will all be over. I won’t have no more pain no more stress no more weight to carry around. I just wish I could change my boyfriend back to the way he was before he started to be like this. I just want to be loved again... I want to feel love again the warmth of someone hugging you tightly when you come home from a long day at work  a kiss that’s not forced. Someone to just smile at you and say I love you sincerely. Instead I get punched slapped grabbed told how worthless I am and how stupid I am or I hate you you dumb whore. He use to be the best boyfriend now we are coming up on 4 years together and things just keep getting worse. I really want to end it all but my little cousin just tried to kill himself and I see how his mom is I don’t want to do that to my family but then again the only one who would care is my mom and her side of the family my dad and his family could careless so I’m just feeling like maybe I should just do this one last thing for me so I can be happy finally because nothing else is gunna help.

I've always been taught to shrug all my problems and blame myself for my situation, rather than other people, but its getting too much now. I've been living on my own for nearly 4 years now. I didn't get on with my family and felt it was unfair on everyone that I stayed, even though my parents think I did it out of spite. I then had to live in a youth hostel for a year, where they gave me help to get on my feet, I was surrounded by friends and people in the same boat as me, so nothing really phased me as we helped each other out. While I was in there I found out my girlfriend at the time was pregnant, shortly after that we split up and she went to a few parties and took a lot of drugs and drank a lot of alcohol, as a result she had a miscarriage... I was devastated. But carried on and a few months down the line I was dooing well had a new girlfriend a flat and things where looking up. I started drinking heavilly shortly after as my parents would constantly guilt trip me and because I had found my biological father, who didn't really like the situation I was in and I think was embarrassed of me. Me and this girl split up after a year of being together as we just grew apart and she was seeing somebody else.I then went into a spiral of drugs drink and depression. Untill one day I got sick of it and dragged myself up and got a job at a local club/bar. Which after a month I became manager of,I met a girl (who I will call 'club girl' as she is a main part of this and I respect keeping her identity disclosed) so club girl used to go to a a friends house when I was there, she basically was a an object of sex to everyone, and she loved it. But stupid me fell for this girl, and fell hard. Me and her used to argue... A lot. She used to use mind games to make me feel worthless and when I used to stick up for myself, she used to hit me and once she pulled a knife to me.... She would go to my boss at work and say id beat her for money for drugs, and get my wages given to her, because of this I started using cocaine an drinking heavily again whenever I could so I didn't care, I still loved her so when she asked me to move in to hers with her I said yea , shortly after I lost my job, and had to sign up for recruitment agency, but the work was few and far between, but it was on enough, little did I know 'club girl' had been sleeping with her ex and a other lad before we had moved in, and had git me to get rid of my flat so that she could kick me out and ruin my life.. And she admitted this. By this time I was already borderline suicidal as of the way she treated me, the fact I had no proper job, and because my family didn't speak to me. I then dragged myself upand got a flat, then she came back into my life and I fell for it again... All the while she has been dooing the same things... My agency has got no work... I cant get a job, I cant trust and im living off literal pennies a day my flat is now not in use as the new landlords did not get an HMO so I have to be out in a month I have crippling debt and have nobody anymore ....

There is no guarentee that if you keep trying again and again you will one day make it.  Until I feel like trying again is worth it, suicide does seem like the better answer.   I worry about how it will affect other people.  But, at the same time, I kind of don't care.   I want to tell people, but that's one of the ways I've lost as much as I have.    If I could manage to just surpress and forget how i've been hurt...  maybe i could try again.  But that too has its own issues.   Who am I?   I got to where I am through luck.  I can't bet on luck all the time.    The world taught me that hurt and damaged people don't deserve friends, don't deserve to be given chances.   If I'm going to have these things again, I have to do it.  I have to force my future onto those around me.   My goals and dreams involve other people.

I admire them when they're successful and lend a helping hand when they're in need. They all understand that I have depression, so naturally, when they find out i may be going through something, they offer to listen to me and let me talk it out.  I'm pretty stubborn, so I don't usually take their offers. To me it feels like an automated response to say ""If you ever need someone to talk to..."" The thing I'm most worried about is if i tell them, Four weeks down the road, when I have no progress, and they ask ""How are things?"" I can either lie and say ""better"" or be honest and say the same.   If I tell the truth to them will they think of me as a sad broken record? The guy who is down and emotionless. I don't know what to say anymore. Understanding that they're my friends, and if they really cared about me they wouldn't abandon me but, I just avoid telling them so they stay around me.  Just me telling my troubles like all you wonderful sad saps out there :)",0.9273,positive,impressed,1,1
152227,depression,Why is talking about it so hard?,SH2355,2.0,"So many people like to keep their friendships and relationships in tact by never testing them and never demanding anything of them, but then that kind of defeats the point of trying to have close relationships with people.   No, you're not wrong for wanting to have a measured response and making sure you don't burn people out by acting like a sad sack all the time. That certainly can frustrate people and push them away. But there has to be a happy medium somewhere. You're extremely lucky to have people who ask how you're doing, whether it's an automatic reflex when they ask or not. I'd love to have friends who asked me how I was doing.   You should be able to respond and tell the truth, but yeah it would probably be for the best that not every single conversation or interaction go down that road. You could approach it slowly and double-check with people if they're sincerely offering to listen. Next time someone asks you can say ""you know what, I could actually use somebody to talk to for a minute. If not right now, could we talk soon?"" and see what they say.   You sound pretty intelligent and self-aware, I'm pretty sure you could navigate the fine line of telling the truth to people but making sure not to over-do it.   Keeping friendships in tact by just avoiding anything uncomfortable is just walking on eggshells, telling lies and stepping softly to try to keep these people around. But what's the point in keeping people around if you can't lean on them when you need to?  If you reached out to any of your friends and they took off running and never came back, sure it might be painful, but all you did is identify that somebody was a fake friend. Too often people look at a situation like that and think ""damn, I caused that to happen because I asked for help or made them uncomfortable"". But you didn't really cause anything. A good friend will be a good friend and a bad one will reveal themselves to be a bad one. Anyone who might run away from a request for support was just a loose thread and a bad friend that was going to fall apart at some point or another anyway.",0.9943,positive,impressed,1,1

2469,depression,"Pretty sure I have dysthymia/dysthymic disorder, and I don't know what to do about it.",sadsack21,1.0,"I've considered that I might have dysthymia for years, but now that it's starting to really seriously interfere with my life, I'm taking this consideration more seriously.  I meet all the criteria, I've been consistently sad for years, probably since I was thirteen (I'm 23 now), with maybe one or two major depressive episodes throughout that whole duration (and one incident when I was in middle school, though I can't remember what age exactly, where I essentially had a breakdown and couldn't set foot outside my house without bursting into tears for a whole week).  I'm sad more often than I'm not, I've never gone more than a month without being overwhelmingly sad at some point, I have really low self-esteem/self-image, when I'm feeling particularly sad I tend to start eating more, and I have much less energy/want to sleep more.  I have been so... apathetic about everything recently.  I have graduate school applications due starting on 12/1 and I still haven't even started my writing sample (which needs to be 30 pages long) because I just have absolutely no drive.  This isn't necessarily because I'm sad, but moreso because I've felt pretty numb recently.  Feeling numb, in turn, usually leads to feeling sad, because I dislike not feeling much of anything, and I dislike how much I am disappointing myself.  It makes me feel broken.  I do feel happy at times, but it is usually only when I'm around people, and it's usually fleeting.  I'm not even sure it's really happiness I'm feeling, it's just that I'm much less sad and presenting with the appearance of happiness because I don't like bumming other people out.  I feel extremely alone and isolated in the world.  I have very few friends any more, though I have a fair number of acquaintances that I spend time with.  They are almost all people from work, and I mostly interact with them at work, though a few of us do have a weekly gathering outside of work as well.  Even so, I don't feel very close to these people.  They are accepting, but we're not close.  I don't feel like I can talk to them about serious or personal things.  None of our conversations ever go beyond observational conversations.  Our weekly gathering is a movie night, and obviously we talk about the movie we watched, but we never talk about much in any of our personal lives.  I miss having close friends that I can really talk to about anything.  I get really sad, too, about being single.  Not only do I not really have any friends any more, but I have never had a boyfriend.  I've been on a grand total of maybe 3 dates in my life, no one has ever taken a real interest in me, and the last time I was kissed was two and a half years ago when I was nearly blackout drunk, and by a guy who was also shitfaced and had a girlfriend (I didn't find this out until well after we made out).  I've never even been kissed romantically.  The only three times have been by guys whose last names I didn't know and who were drunk off their asses and just looking for a hookup with someone they thought would be desperate enough to give it up.  As the token overweight girl at pretty much every party I go to, I'm usually a target for the truly drunk and desperate.  Luckily, for how low my self-esteem is, I haven't been desperate enough to do anything I'd really regret, so it's only been drunken make-outs.  But I want more.  I want someone, who is sober, to actually like me, to be attracted to me.  But no one does and I hate it and I hate myself for being so undesirable.  And every time I try to get healthy and eat right and start exercising, I end up giving up and going back to my old unhealthy habits and hating myself for that, too.  I do have moments of astonishing resolve, and there are times I really try to convince myself that I'm awesome and I love me, but disliking myself always wins out eventually.  I'm drowning in debt, I don't have health insurance, or money to see a counselor or a therapist, and I graduated from college last year so I don't have access to my university's free counseling sessions (I was supposed to go to graduate school starting this fall, but I didn't get in anywhere, so these applications are round two).  I'm stuck in a shit job that I hate, and that doesn't offer any insurance for people in my position (part time, fixed employment end-date).  I don't know how to fix myself, but I want to.  I'm sorry this turned into a bit of a rant, I guess I just needed to get it all out there, since I don't normally have anyone to talk to about all of this.  Does anyone out there have tips on coping with dysthymia without access to a counselor for talk therapy or a psychiatrist for medication?  I know this is a little different from depression, but there are some definite similarities, and dysthymia is usually briefly described as less severe but more chronic version of depression.",-0.9908,negative,encouraging,1,1

On top of bursting into tears when I would just set one foot out of the house I was overwhelmingly depressed and anxious. * I have definitely been experiencing some anhedonia.  I'm not finding a lot of things as pleasurable as I used to.  I don't enjoy research like I used to, watching movies and tv is more just a matter of going through the motions than actually watching and enjoying, and I can't seem to stay fixed on anything for too long.  I always end up on the internet or going to the kitchen to make food or do dishes where normally I could sit through a two and a half hour movie no problem. * Well, as I said, I'm not sure I'm actually ""happy,"" just less sad.  Positive interpersonal interaction pleases me, especially because I spend so much time alone.  I'm lucky to have become acquaintances/friends with that group from work (the ones that do movie night) because they are very non-judgmental.  However, when I'm in social situations where I don't know anyone or know very few people, I get uncomfortable because I imagine I'm being judged, and I'm afraid to speak up and be myself because I figure people wont like who I am. * I, too, have been rejected a fair few number of times.  Mostly in high school, when I had some guts and would actually approach boys that I liked, and would tell them so.  After high school I stopped trying because I learned early that putting yourself out there hurts too bad and nobody wants me.  And I tend to stop working on myself because... well, I don't know why.  I think I might be afraid of success.  What if I lose all this weight and people still don't like me?  A confirmation that my personality is unbearable and I'm too horrible a person to be dated is one of the most soul-crushing things I can think of.

40929,depression,Is getting help with depression meant to be hard?,NotAnAvocado,1.0,"I saw a psychiatrist in January who told me that I had anxiety and depression problems ""with a hint of OCD,"" and that I should go see a psychologist and get me some Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy. Which, of course, I never did. Partially because my parents were like ""hey we don't believe in psychology. All the answers to your problems are in your head so you can deal with them on your own"" and partially because the idea of ""seeing a therapist"" seems really Desperate Housewives-esque.  In the last six weeks, the problem(s) have rapidly gotten worse. I kinda gave my partner a panic attack when I told her about the stuff I'd been feeling, which was terrifying for all concerned. She basically said that I need to get help, and I agreed that she was totally right (half because she was and half because she was hyperventilating and I wanted her to stop). That was a week ago, and I continue to avoid making an appointment with a GP. I walk past the GP's office regularly, and even looking at it makes me anxious because (a) I feel guilty for not yet properly seeking treatment and (b) the idea of walking in there and admitting that I am a fundamentally flawed human being is not pleasant.  If (and, I guess, when) I see a GP they'll refer me to a psych who will then do some CBT. I have serious doubts over whether that will work. I have a pretty good idea of what CBT consists of and I just don't think I'll gain anything from it.  I've got one party telling me that my problems aren't really severe enough to warrant medical intervention, and the other telling me that I really need help. I fill the arbitrary criteria for major depressive disorder. I guess I want to (and should) get help, but I'm fairly confident that nothing will work and I will end up right where I am now minus a lot of time and money. Seeking treatment for depression does not seem worthwhile.  So, regardless of whether you read the preceding novel or not, I'm wondering what motivated you to get help with depression? Why did you finally decide to make an appointment with a GP or a therapist or whoever? How did you overcome your fears regarding diagnosis and treatment (if any)?",-0.9503,negative,trusting,1,1
40929,depression,Is getting help with depression meant to be hard?,hiddenhalf,2.0,"I decided to get help when I realized that I was unhappy 100% of the time.  My favorite coffee drinks didn't taste as magical anymore, and in what little off-time I had (I'm in the Navy, and sometimes off-time is a joke), I could think of nothing except how miserable I was going to be coming into work on Monday morning.  As I was stationed onboard a ship, options for treatment were sometimes extremely limited.  I would have to wait days to weeks to a full month until the ship got back, to seek my next avenue of support.  During those waiting periods, the depression and work stress built up until I thought:  ""If I don't talk to someone professional about this, I'm going to do something extreme.  Maybe I'll punch somebody.  Maybe I'll scream at the captain.  Maybe I'll....""  It's a dark, constricting, frightening place to be, when you're at that point.  I was raised in a background just like yours.  When I was feeling like there was no place to turn, and something made me call my parents and tell them ""I think I need treatment for depression because I have urges to do something fucked up"", they came up with ten thousand excuses for it.  I'm just tired, I have a vitamin deficiency, maybe this Navy thing just isn't right for you, etc.   It has taken me a LONG time to accept that just because they've known what's best for me for 18 years, they're NOT me, and I'm not them; and they have obviously never experienced anything this mentally/emotionally crippling before.  Edit:  Oh, and also, I imagined that someday I might lash out or something at a family dinner; in the long run, that's not how I wanted my parents to eventually find out I have a legitimate issue.  I talked to several different counselors, but in the military we have lots of ""in-betweens"":  they don't really perform the therapy, but they let you vent, and recommend more qualified counselors and therapists.  Every single time, I made absolutely sure about their policies regarding complete confidentiality, and I felt safe unloading my thoughts.  To be honest, I ate up the stigma about depression with a large spoon.  I thought people were going to think that I'm crazy, or someone is going to go overboard and assume I'm a suicide risk and lock me in a room somewhere.  I pictured all the wild assumptions based upon what I've seen on TV or in the movies.  Fortunately, it's not like that; and when I think about how often depression is getting attention in the media, or when I hear a friend open up about his/her own experiences regarding depression, I come to realize that we're not sub-human just because we experience a set of harsh, debilitating feelings.  I won't bullshit you on this though -- many people on the Internet have shitty things to say about their counselors/therapists.  But I got lucky and just so happened to be paired with one who had an extraordinary personality and a sharp sense of compassion and empathy.  He didn't tell me what to do, but he took everything I said and compiled it into ""You feel shitty because of factors A through Z.  So this week we're going to work on A+B+C, and while you think about these things between now and next week, I think you'll make the right adjustments.""  Anyway, I can't speak for everyone else's experience with talk therapy and CBT, but remember that nobody's forcing you to see exclusively this one person; you can change to another.  I now fully understand that these people have all the right training and education to talk to me about this stuff for a reason, and if I feel uncomfortable at first, I just have to give it that one or two more tries to see if it'll feel right in time.

I don't understand, I thought I liked all the stuffs about computer science, I love finishing a code or making a project in cyber security by myself  but in the meantime, it's just so hard for me to work for the school stuff.

315328,offmychest,It’s all about the broken arm,Frugalista1,1.0,"The title pretty much says it. About four months ago I fell in my house and broke my right arm, my humerus to be exact. I am right handed naturally. I have a whole host of other medical conditions and so when I went to the hospital for my arm they said I was not well enough for surgery right away and sent me home in a brace.  Long story short one of those other medical conditions kicked in and I never did get to go home, I ended up on a ventilator. So now I’ve been seeing my orthopedic guy and according to the x-rays the break is not healing. Because of my osteoporosis, plus that I’m postmenopausal, the doctor said it’s never going to heal on its own. Unfortunately, I’m also not a candidate for surgery because of the whole ventilator thing. I almost died then, so they don’t want to chance it again.  My arm is pretty non-functional, I can hold it in a 90° angle but I can’t lift my hand any higher than that. The arm is also fairly weak. I’ve had to adjust to a lot of new normals in the last decade, but this one’s giving me the most trouble.  Every day I realize something new that I can’t do. I’ve become pretty good with my left hand, I can eat with it, I can open things like toothpaste with it, but I can’t do everything. The first thing was writing out the bills, yeah I’m old so I write checks. I can’t do that anymore so I’ve had my husband do it, but he’s not great at it.  The holidays are coming and I realized I won’t be able to wrap gifts. I also won’t be able to write out Christmas cards to friends and family. Just every month there’s something new that I can’t do and it’s getting to be extremely frustrating.  I’ve learned to live with a lot of things over the years, but this just feels like a bridge too far. I’m having real troubles getting over it.",0.9428,positive,prepared,1,1

104480,offmychest,Some depression confessions,iB_Raii,1.0,"Hello reddit. Long time lurker with multiple accounts (create, post three or four things, delete, repeat), now going to try to use this as a medium through which to turn things around. But to do so, I need to get some things off my chest.   For the last few years, I've dealt with depression. It started my junior year of high school and persisted to my freshman year of college. Had a few suicidal thoughts in those years, but they were few and very minor (thought about what would happen if I were to do it, and once contemplated putting my car into a ditch from a gravel road). Self-harmed slightly, in ways that people wouldn't suspect (people expect teenage boys to have bruised knuckles, so I could get away with punching doors/walls/etc without people wondering). But I would usually just shut down and not show any emotion. My friends called it ""iB Raii's mood.""  As college went on, I met some friends that helped me turn my life around. I was on anti-depressants going into college, but I met a guy who brought me into the gym and started helping me exercise. It noticeably turned my life around. Fitness became my life, and subsequently my major in college. I started running 5Ks and lifting, and noticed myself becoming happier, healthier, and more outgoing. I thought I had found my natural antidepressant, and that I was done with my meds for the rest of my life. I knew depression wasn't something you could ""beat,"" but I thought I found the thing that I could use to help me for the rest of my life. I went through my sophomore, junior, and senior years of college with little issue. I had my flare-ups, of course, but overall I did very well.  Most people know everything up to this point, so that's not what I want to get off my chest. It's everything that's happened post-graduation (ish) that I need to tell someone.  Shit started going downhill this past May. I was in a committed relationship for over a year with a girl. She was wonderful, we had talked about getting married, we were about to move in together, it was great. I'd never been so sure about something in my life. But within our relationship, I was a piece of shit. I was kind of selfish, and somewhat of a compulsive liar (let me clarify: it was never anything serious. I would tell her my phone died instead of just admitting that I forgot to text her back, things like that. Things not worth lying about). She caught me in one of these shitty lies, and we got in a fight about it. A few weeks pass, and ultimately I decided to break it off. I blamed it on her not willing to talk about some of the issues we were having, but it was ultimately me not knowing how to best make a relationship work. I didn't realize that relationships like this took work, and I decided to jump ship the second I felt like something was off. I could have saved it (in retrospect), but chose not to. That was part one.  At this same time, I had a required internship to culminate my degree (somewhat like a senior capstone project). It was working with children with mental and developmental disabilities. I'd worked with this population before, so I enjoyed working with the kids. However, I could not stand my supervisor or the owner. I was doing everything in my power to make ""attitude adjustments"" that they requested (even though I legitimately thought my attitude was fine; super open to criticism), and to progress the three different projects I was assigned to over the three months. During this time, coupled with my relationship issues, I developed severe anxiety. I would have panic attacks in the bathroom at my internship, and had to try to maintain myself during the six hours I spent in this place. Also contributing to my stress was the fact that this internship was unpaid, so I had to work two more jobs to pay my rent/bills/etc. So during this time, I was working approximately 70 hours a week, with only 45 of them being paid. The trigger point for me, however, was about halfway through this internship. I started driving to my internship, and I started getting dizzy. Didn't know where I was, and I would black out for 3-5 seconds at a time. I got about 15 miles down the road and realized I shouldn't be driving. I pulled off to a rest area and I burst into tears. Everything fell apart at that moment, I realized that everything I had in life was falling apart, and it was out of my control.   It's been about 9 months since that moment, and not much has changed. I got back on my meds about a month ago, but some things about these past few months have scared me, and I don't think I can tell anybody this without them becoming incredibly worried.  The suicidal thoughts have become more prevalent lately. The past few months, as I've been driving to work, it's a conscious effort to not drift my car into oncoming traffic. ""At least then,"" I think to myself, ""it would look like an accident."" Shortly after that thought hits, though, I'm able to rationalize my way out of it. My desire to live outweighs the negative thoughts, but sometimes it's a battle. I've started having some other self-destructive thoughts lately as well, none of which I've acted on, but they still scare me. Obviously, antidepressants and alcohol don't mix, but I've thought about having a few drinks after work, just because. Or popping pain pills unnecessarily. Sometimes I skip dinner as ""punishment"" for.. something. Honestly not sure what.   As of right now, I don't know where my life is going. I hate my job, but I have to work there to survive. I don't have a place to live come August. I want to go to grad school but year after year I keep getting delayed. My friend group that I've had for years is falling apart, as they all graduate and move on to other things. I really want to move to another state, start fresh, and try to forget these last 10 months. I can honestly say that this has been the worst time of my life.  I'm trying to take on this lifestyle of ""do what makes you happy, even if it goes against society's expectations."" It's made me want to start a Youtube channel for gaming, start a Soundcloud for my music, things like that. But with depression that saps the life out of you for every hour you're awake, it's hard to do those things.  In case anyone cares, I'm in a safe place with regards to all my self-harm and suicidal thoughts. Haven't acted on them, and have no plan to. Sometimes that voice just makes itself heard, and it scares me.",-0.9868,negative,hopeful,1,1

304034,offmychest,I don’t want to live with my dad but don’t want to hurt him,Ending-afy,1.0,"My parents are getting divorced and in a few weeks my mother will hopefully be moving out. (If we get the house) I’m not very upset by the divorce anymore, it was a long time coming and I’ve known since the beginning of the year, we just had to wait for the money. My parents have been fighting for ages and so has my  brother and dad. I don’t want anyone to know who I am and my brother has a weird name so let’s call him  Ben I guess.  Ben means a lot to me. I know other brothers and sisters fight all the time we’re not really like that. We don’t talk very often since he’s never really home but he’s fun to talk to when he’s around and whenever one of us goes to the shops we get each other something. Anyway Ben and dad fight all the time. Like REALLY bad. It never usually gets physical, the worst that’s ever happened is some pushes and throwing some stuff. And even then no one was hurt. Ben can get really defensive, whereas I just run away at the first sign of conflict. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t talk to either of my parents anymore except for a few short ‘hello’s and ‘goodbye’s.  Anyway the reason I included that was to give you an idea of how I felt. Nothing hurt more than seeing someone I cared about getting hurt. Of course, I cared for dad too, but he has a short temper and I don’t think he’s in a good spot mentally, and he often gets unnecessarily angry ans honestly, I blame him for most of this. I don’t know how to feel anymore. I love him because he’s family but I also kind of hate him because of what he’s done. Anyway, I’m not sure if bens gonna live with dad anymore, he said he wasn’t going to for a long time but recently they’ve been getting along better and I think he’s gonna live with dad every second week, like I planned to. As I mentioned before, (this is super messy sorry) I pretty much retreat at any sign of conflict and because of this I’m dads favourite child. Sounds good I guess but I hate it. I know it’ll hurt him if I say that I don’t want to live with him, which I truly don’t, but I also don’t want to hurt him. As I said before (again this is a mess sorry) he’s not in a good spot mentally and I’m scared that if he loses me he’ll have lost all his family. I’m kind of scared of at this rate anything more goes wrong he’ll leave for ever, or turn to alcohol, or self harm. And obviously I don’t want that for anyone, it’s horrible, but I can’t be around him without feeling like shit. I just don’t know what to do. Sorry for all the tangents and stuff I probably repeated.",-0.9937,negative,embarrassed,1,1

From his perspective, it could feel like he's losing everything and completely losing his kids could send him further down the wrong road. From your perspective, how you feel when your around him now could completely change because he could become a lot happier after the divorce. Give him a chance to see what path he decides to take but set a time frame so you're not still living with him months down the road, still feeling the same way hoping it will change. I hope this helps more, good luck.",0.9734,positive,furious,1,1

278531,offmychest,Something I really need a few advice on,harlemskake,1.0,"(Excuse me if my english is bad and long post alert)  My story is about my romantic life. I'm 18, just finished high school and took an entrance exam to university.  She and I have been classmate for 3 years and I sit directly behind her. As you can tell that i'm extremely into her. To be honest, in the first 2 and a half years, there was not much stuff happening between us, we barely had a real conversation. During this time, I had a slight feeling for her but because it wasn't intense and also a friend of mine had a crush on her, I backed down.  Things really started to grow on me a few months ago when I noticed she had gestures that seemingly implied that she liked me. She smiled to what I said all the time, took awkward pictures of me and made fun of them and especially, she loved playing with my hair. And those little things made me fall for her.  However, when my friend asked her whether she liked me or not, she said no (what?). I knew that so I texted her, told her how I felt (I dont know if it was too late). And she said she just considered me as a friend. But she also said she wasn't ready for a relationship then and needed time to give me a proper answer. I had some kind of hope.  A month went by and every day just intensified my feeling for her. Until 2 days ago, I asked her again. Her answer, you know, was still a no. She just wants us to be ""best friends"" but ""not to take things further"".   The problem is after 2 times of being rejected, despite having prepared for anything to come, I'm still not ready to lose her. I'm in too deep to get out now. What should I do now? Be stubborn and ask her for a fresh start, back to get-to-know-each-other stage or just move on. I can't take things easily because if I fail this time, i'm likely to lose that one small friendship we have left. But I don't want to move on since I want her in my future not just as a friend. I can't make up my mind at the moment and it's killing me. But either ways, I know I'm gonna regret for the rest of my life.  That is my story and as I said, I'm 18 so I'm not mature or experienced enough to deal with this. I need your help and I'm open to listen.",0.9861,positive,furious,1,1
278531,offmychest,Something I really need a few advice on,haybautista,2.0,"It seems like she's just trying to let you down nicely. I think you should just move on, and as you start to move on your friendship will eventually pick up to where it was before.

278531,offmychest,Something I really need a few advice on,haybautista,5.0,"It sounds like you've been pretty consistent with showing her how you feel, and you've straight up told her already a few times so I think that's far from being weak on your end. If she had even the slightest feelings for you she would at least put in effort to explore if there is any sort of future or connection with you instead of just turning you down. Even if she is the one, it will just happen naturally without force. Just focus on yourself and the one for you will come when it's meant to be. When I was your age I focused so much on trying to be in a relationship and put way too much thought into what could've been with people. But when I finally stopped, I met my boyfriend without even trying and now we've been together for 6 years since high school. It really just happens when you don't expect it.",0.2023,positive,furious,1,1

249638,offmychest,I am going to commit suicide if I fail this course,throwaway19910410,1.0,"I want to start by saying this is **not** a call for help.  Currently I'm part, along with 11 other guys, of a very exclusive one-year-long course provided by the government of my country in order to be part of a very exclusive branch of said government. This course is very demanding, imagine *The Pursuit of Happyness*, but with less homelessness and with more available positions (10).   I've always wanted to be part of this specific branch, it is my dream, I went to the university specifically to be there, and now, at 29, I finally have a shot at it. I'm doing quite good so far, and the competition for a position is getting lighter (originally we were 13, and one of the current guys is probably dropping out soon), but the real problem of course is the competition against myself, there is always the possibility of having a Fail grade somewhere that can take me out of the race. I'm doing my best in order to avoid such outcome, but shit happens, and some ugly shit has happened to me before.  Now, I've made my mind up. If I, by any reason, fail this course, I'm going to commit suicide. Again this is my dream, I'm very very very excited about this, I've told every friend, family member, and acquaintance that I'm in this course, that my future is going to be in this branch, and that I simply don't see myself anywhere else. I already took the conscious decision of not being ever in any other job. To me having other options is not an option, it is either this or nothing at all.  I know this sounds extreme, and TBH it is, but this is not a sudden or impulsive decision. I've been thinking about this for over 2 years, and I've been convinced and sure of it since a bit more than 1 year ago, and since then I sit and seriously ponder and rethink it again at least once every month (when that happens I google ""Reasons to not commit suicide"" and so far not a single one seems convincing), and the conclusion is always the same.   I was depressed in my early 20's, and I was medically assessed in order to determine if I had any other mental health condition (thankfully no), so I know my decision is not because depression (because right now I'm 100% sure I'm not, I'm quite happy and motivated actually) or any other health issue. I also have no living parents, children or SO, and my relatives have wonderful lives on their own, so my death, although is likely to affect them, is not going to destroy or seriously upset them in the long term, so no issues there either.   I've thought of all the possible bad outcomes my suicide might bring to others, and none of them are too serious, I even know how and where to do it in order to minimize the problem for those picking up my body (I thought about using a shotgun, but it is messy and shotguns are not easy to obtain here, so suicide bag it is, I already located a good nitrogen dealer and even picked up a song to listen while doing it -The Great Gig in the Sky, for those curious-), and I already have a will registered with my lawyer (something that *everybody* should do, even if you are not planning to kill yourself).  Again, this is not a call for help (and don't be like everyone else and say ""call the suicide hotline"", because there is none in my country), I just wanted to tell someone about this, because if I do it I'm not leaving any note, so posting here is the only explanation I'll be giving to the universe (that last bit sounds silly, but you get the idea).
