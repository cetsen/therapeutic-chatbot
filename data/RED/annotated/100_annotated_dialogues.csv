618,MentalHealthSupport,Anyone else frustrated by this?,RoseBunny8,1,"So I posted yesterday that I'm in a relapse of my depression. Today was a lot better than yesterday, which is good.   I'm just wondering if anyone else gets frustrated when people/friends say something to the effect of ""oh I understand needing mental health days"" or ""I've been depressed sometimes too""?  Like I get theyre trying to be helpful and relate to me but having life long depression where every day your fighting your own brain is not the same as needing a ""mental health day"".   Yes I'm doing better today, but better here does not mean I'm all good and everything is solved. It means that I'm having a relatively good day where I can stay awake for more than an hour at a time and it doesnt feeling like every waking moment my brain is not telling me to kill myself or how much I suck.   How does everyone else respond to these well meaning ""I get it"" messages when you really feel like they don't? Do you just smile and nod or try to help them truly understand?",0.9436,positive,joyful,1,1

1340,MentalHealthSupport,I have to keep myself busy to not get sad but the stress from not relaxing is taking a toll on me.,TerryCrewsLovesYaoi,1,"Im 18 and currently in highschool. I enjoy it but it's tough so I study a lot at home in order to keep my grades up.I also work part time at a fast food restaurant and I'm currently in training to become a manager which is very exciting and would be great to have on my resume so I'm working very hard. Often 25-35 hour weeks. There are also a bunch of tests and things that I have to do at home in order to become a verified manager so my days are usually packed.  I'm also doing what I can to finish homework and get passing grades in school. I promised myself before I took the job a year ago that I can't let it get in the way of my education.  Over all I work and study for a total of 70-90 hours every week and have done so for a few months (not counting the summer ofc). I have fun at work and school and I finish things in time but I have noticed myself becoming tired, sad and stressed whenever I have free time. I also fear I'm no longer fun to be with because of my lack of energy and whenever I'm in social situations outside of school and work, I become tired and sorta quite fast. Whenever I'm by myself watching TV or playing video games or whatever I do to relax, I get anxiety and become super stressed. This started happening a few months ago but it's been gradually becoming worse.  Whenever I actually get an opportunity to relax, I feel myself becoming stressed and sad so I find something else to do. I'm now always trying to keep myself busy in order to not get anxious but not taking the time to sleep and relax is obviously making the stress worse.  I feel like I'm in a bad loop where I have to keep myself busy all the time but I'm stressed out over not having enough time to relax.  I haven't talked to anybody about this. Any advice is appreciated!  Thank you.",0.5572,positive,anticipating,1,1

1048,MentalHealthSupport,I'm getting a bit worried,ChocoMilk996,1,"Hello, everyone. Is it normal for me to pick at my skin multiple times a day? I have acne and I can't get my hands off my face or even the rest of my body. I pick at my scabs to the point of drawing blood sometimes and it's strange but oddly satisfying in a way. It's caused me a lot of scarring and I think it only makes the picking worse. I had a similar habit in the past as a kid when I would pluck out my hair and eyelashes, but I eventually controlled those urges. I find that playing games keeps my hands occupied but not for long.

1048,MentalHealthSupport,I'm getting a bit worried,hpnerd2,2,"Hello! It may just be a bad habit, but there’s also a name for a mental illness for this. (I’m a psych major so I’ve studied it before in college). The name of it is Excoriation disorder. It may help to research it. BUT if it is just a habit, I’ve had it as one (never the disorder). For me, I had to self examine to see why I was doing it. I learned it as a coping skill when my anxiety got too much. Whenever I noticed it happening, I told myself to stop. Over time, it got easier. I tended to do it on my arms and fingers so I wear longer sleeves and paint my nails really nice too. So for your face, you could try makeup or just being proud of a really good skin routine.

670,MentalHealthSupport,Pyromania?..,_HiddenMask_,1,"I have recently spoken to a phsyciatrist (forced :) about these issues and he recommended admitting me into a hospital out of safety reasons. Of course because of pricing being high we couldn't really say no or yes until we're sure it's absolutely necessary.   So lately for the past what.. About a month or two? I've been using fire as an outlet. Burning things began with candles and went onto paper, then notebooks, and now books as large as dictionaries. I won't really go into detail on emotions during the moments, but I know it helps. Sometimes it's difficult to hold back heavy urges to burn myself or others. Though holding back didn't work very long and I now have marks from either dripping hot wax onto myself or holding my hand above flames.   My mother and friends have called me names because of it..

I’ve been getting low grades no matter how hard I try, I suffering from limitations. To make it worse I spend most of my time by myself at school and kept up in the solitude of my room. And yeah it’s lonely, I’m an introvert but I’m just so damn lonely. I know that I have a girlfriend who loves me but why isn’t she here when I need her the most. I don’t blame her I just wish I could just let her know, if I do, I don’t know if she’ll listen or care and that’s what I’m scared about. That’s why I can’t message her. I’m scared even more because if I’m not open with communication in my relationship I risk losing her. I don’t know what to do I’m lost (mentally) and im scared and yet again I have no one to talk to. I don’t want to have another depressive season, it’s one of the most important years, year 12, for me. It reflects my future career.

They don’t tell you about all the 3am breakdowns you’ll endure, or how everything seems worse at night. They tell you, you may loose your appetite. They don’t tell you about the days that you don’t even have the energy to eat, or how sick food can make you feel. They tell you, you’ll be tired sometimes. They don’t tell you how it doesn’t matter how much you sleep you’ll always feel exhausted, or that some days you’ll be so tired even brushing your hair is a mountain to climb. They tell you, you may become distant from others. They don’t tell you it’s because you feel unworthy enough to enjoy the company of others, or how sometimes you just can’t face the world. They tell you, you might feel the need to harm yourself. They don’t tell you about the shame you feel as you purposely hurt your body, or the need to have some control over your life as it spirals - even if that way is inflicting pain.

The only thing that seems to work these days is sticking on YouTube or an audiobook and shutting my eyes. The talking makes my mind listen, and if it's something I've seen/heard a million times before, it knocks me out within an hour or two, which is practically miraculous for me. I'm not a professional, or any kind of sleep expert, just someone who suffers with severe intrusive thoughts.

398,MentalHealthSupport,Ovwhelmed and lack of motivation,fake_zealer,1,"I have a lot going on in my life. I'm 17 years old and I'm currently in foster care. I just got admitted to university this past week, I'm struggling with a couple of my highschool classes, and I'm dealing with the trauma of my past. (You gotta be in foster care for a reason.)   I've been in foster care for over a while (it'll be a year in march) and I say I've been handling things pretty well. I have only had less than a handful of instances where I broke down and cried.   But since I got admitted into university all of that has pretty much changed. I've been hit full on in the face with reality and its super hard. I've found that I have no real motivation for life other than ensuring my future happens. It's hard for me to get homework done and for me to keep trudging on.   I've just been so overwhelmed that I'm really depressed and have been feeling suicidal. I'm barely holding onto my sanity by a mere few threads.   Like just tonight, I had finished cooking dinner for my family and I sat down to eat. I had my headphones on and was watching youtube. But my foster mom a few feet away was shrillingily talking super loud. She just wouldn't shut up and it just sent me over the brim. (Plus my younger sister was just super sassy with me.) I ended up rushing up the stairs only to cry my eyes out, totally freaked out.  Normally shit like that wouldn't upset me but the noise just totally overwhelmed me.  I have a good relationship with my foster parents and I'm normally super open to talking with them, but I'm scared to mention the suicidal part to my foster parents because that is taken super seriously.   I just don't know what to do. I'm currently in therapy but its biweekly and doesn't do much. Does anyone have any advice for finding motivation as well as helping with the overwhelming feeling?

7945,Anxietyhelp,[13] fit teen. Weird sensation when surprised or excited.,Fluffy_Charge_59,1,Hey I’ve been having anxiety for a while ever since qurantine started. It started when I was lying down weird and I felt something drop in my throat. It ended up being silent reflux. And I’ve been taking a powdered  ant acid that I put in water  however I’ve been kinda slacking since I don’t take it everyday. I’m on and off about it because I still have some days to go with it but it’s pretty much fixed. It did come back once but I took the medicine again and after a day of taking it and drinking water it went away again.  Then I started getting ringing in the ears but that was due to anxiety too because once I stopped getting stressed about it it went away     But with this. Even after I’m not being stressed about it it can randomly hit me. Idk maybe it’s because when I get excited sometimes I think about it while I’m still excited or surprised and it hits quick. Making me think it just randomly happened. But yea I’ve spoken to some online doctor and he also said it was anxiety. It usually happens the most at night when I’m very sleepy. That’s why I’ve been trying to go to sleep before I get insanely sleepy or else I will get those panic attacks which give me those sensations.ive also been getting the skipping of heart feeling too sometimes. My parents said that’s normal as well but it’s been happening a lot. It didn’t happen that much today until I got stressed again.   I’m pretty much 100% that it’s anxiety because all this time I was relaxed it barely happened and when it did I was sure it was from post anxiety still trying to heal. And again it only happens a lot when I’m stressed not much when I’m relaxed.  Plus I’m on my 13 and I’m in shape. I guess I’m just looking for these comments to ease it.     Also question. Can doing something intense cause chest pain or aching? Because before I did that intense thing my chest wasn’t getting a zap and wasn’t having slight pain. I just don’t want this to build up. And I really don’t want to get on medications or therapy because every time I’ve had anxiety of some sort I’ve fixed it myself or my family fixed it. The zap feeling is probably the least common of them I think it only happened 2 times.  But the slight pain doesn’t even hurt that much hurts less than a pinch.

4085,Anxietyhelp,How should I set up my own boundaries to friends who have depression too and want to vent?,Spiderbendy,1,"I love my friends so dearly but I’m now working on myself in therapy and learning CBT so I finally was honest with myself.   I wear myself thin. I get borderline anxiety any time they vent to me, because more often than not, I am not equipped to help them. I can listen but I don’t know how to give advice or even what Comfort Words ™ to say. But I’ve heard/seen that in order to be a good friend, you have to be there for their highs and lows. So I figured I Had to be available for them to vent anytime they needed? But I get into this mode of “I Have To Help Them” regardless of how I immediately stress out since I know one wrong word can make them feel worse or I could give them bad advice.   I suppose I need to be working on myself to be able to be there for friends, cuz it’s not their fault I stress myself by over thinking.   So I think my overall question is, what is a healthy friendship? Should I be putting up such a harsh boundary of Never venting to me? (*My mother forces me to hear her vents 24/7 so it wears me down, then to add my friends who are in way more difficult situations, makes me feel almost responsible for them too*)  Have any of you had this experience?",0.9229999999999999,positive,anxious,1,1
4085,Anxietyhelp,How should I set up my own boundaries to friends who have depression too and want to vent?,abuffalonickle,2,"Oh love, your heart is in the right place, but that place is how we got here. And I say “we” because I am the same way. It is in fact the healthiest of relationships that are honest. It’s hard to tell your friends you have nothing left in the tank to give cause you’re barely hanging on yourself. Truly hard. Because we are the “strong” ones. And at least for me, I held myself to that standard always.... until I broke. Doesn’t make you any less strong, doesn’t make you weak, but it does make you HUMAN! None of us can carry everyone’s loads, and it’s not fair to tell yourself you can and if these people are your friends they will understand. Vulnerability is hard, but that conversation will relieve you of a “responsibility” that truly isn’t yours alone. Be honest. With your friends and most importantly yourself. You can’t do it all, all the time my friend. 10/10 your friends want you at your best, and if they understood how you felt they would get it. You are human, and you are loved for being that.

I've been here a year basically I'm having horrible work anxiety to the point where I'm having trouble getting out of bed. As I'm laying here at 10:45 am,  I have work at 2 and it's seriously affecting my mental health at this point  Back story  We sell shoes of course, my shift is from 2-7,today and tomorrow Yesterday I felt the same and had to convince myself not to ghost my job or call out It doesn't pay well. 10$ an hour, my checks are about 5.% of my actual money, but we do have a 50% discount which is great  At this point, that's all I want. I'm not passionate about the work  I get uncomfortable here for a number of reasons: The temperature is very cold, low 60s always, my body temp gets confused. I get hot/cold for hours and can't control it Poor scheduling I've tried to change my availability and nobody has listened to me My manager is nice but on her terms, I don't think she will give a fuck about my mental health and will fire me if I cant work at 100% for any reason They are very concerned with performance but don't communicate well  Vibe of the store is very depressing to me I'm now so anxious it's making me physically sick  and I'm not allowed to switch shifts with people!    I feel so hurt and guilty, yesterday I was an emotional mess inside and couldn't work fully. I was late by half hour, scared to walk into work,icouldn't focus on the register and I created a long line by accident,luckily my one manager cares about me and let me go home an hour early.  We are understaffed because vans hates to hire new people and its so much pressure when really its not paying us much at all.   My other jobs i can work on my own time, and I'm waiting to start a new job in the cannabis dispensary..  My family and friends love my discount and I do love being able to get shoes but I feel I can't do this anymore  What do I do?

I am a Psychology student and the dissertation is on the effect sleep disturbances on mental health (including anxiety, depression and suicidal behaviours).   There is a mass of evidence showing how taking part in studies on mental health is beneficial for those who are suffering (Gibson, Boden, Benson, &amp; Brand, 2014, Wong, Kwok, Michel, &amp; Wong, 2017), it has also been seen to greatly reduce suicidal ideation.

I was happy  I thought everything will be back to normal, however since then he keeps going with my other friends and they never call me if they go out, it became that my friends only answer me if I call them and they never call me, I keep getting anxious non stop that I am out of the group and that my friend is trying to seperate me. I became so anxious I cannot sleep many times and I feel my heartbeat becoming fast for a long period of time.

6822,depressed,Self isolation has got me down...,Darkerfaerie,2,Have you talked to your boyfriend about it? Is he willing to help you motivate yourself so you can start getting back on track?   One thing that helps me get out of bed when my husband is home is when he tells me he wants to be with me but that he won't come to bed. Its endearing and helps motivate me to get my ass out of bed.   Try to find some reason to do things. And dont worry about how much or how big it is.

I feel like I'm behind a mask and I just smile and look pretty just so that I can get through a conversation. I want to show my emotions here and not be judged.  I'm a Junior in high school and I now have 2 weeks off. I'm attracted to this girl in my English class and I'm worried that I'm never going to see her again. I never really talked to her and she never really talked to me. I don't want to miss a chance to get to know her. There's no real solution now and I've thought of everything.  My school friends are not helping either. I feel like they are slowly drifting away. Most of my friends I originally made in 8th grade are either gone, or have broken off due to disagreements. My only two remaining friends are slowly drifting away. One of them is no longer in school most of the time due to social issues and my other friend now spends most of his time with his girlfriend. I'm not blaming them for their social issues or having a girlfriend, I just feel like I'm being spoiled by saying that my friends are starting to not care about me.  I just want to lie on the ground and breathe right now. I don't want my life to get cut short just because of a few shitty moments. I want to go back to 8th grade when responsibilities like applying for college and driving weren't there and my friend group was actually there for me. This is the first time I've felt depressed and it really started hitting me hard in January and it's been on and off ever since.  I don't want to invite friends over because then it feels like a chore to talk and not just do my own thing. I can't make new friends now because I'm trapped in my house. I just want someone who can be there for me (and I can be there for them).

The past 3 years were getting slowly better. Everything the past 6 months have been fantastic! Up and coming me and the lady's 3rd year, school going better, finally losing weight, everything just felt better. Then... since the last 2 weeks have been shitty. I can see it when she talks to me she's disinterested. Hasn't texted me in those 2 weeks, along with her seeming distant since Valentine's Day, but I didn't wanna believe it. School has been getting harder since people don't seem interested in talking to me. Not even the one teacher who enjoyed my company. Both my parents enjoy the company of my sisters better since they got kids. They don't talk with me ever anymore. Everything feels like it's falling apart and I feel like I did something wrong. 2nd night of sleeping alone and I hate it. That pain in my gut of being alone has come back and I hate it. I look in the mirror and I hate it. I think she might be ready to leave me. Everyone else has lost faith in me or has dropped any sort of relationship so why stick around me? I've been staring at my gun the past few nights waiting for her to tell me she's leaving. Wake up to either a note in my room or a text. I'm about to lose everything and I just want to cry and end it because it feels like I somehow fucked everything up with family and friends and I don't wanna be alone again with nothing. I attempted suicide a few months before meeting her. Ever since I had her in my life I never wanted to. I feel like if she leaves and that connection is gone I might just snap.

5368,depressed,I'm done with my family and can't bear them anymore,sorter_plainview,1,"It's been a year and half since I diagnosed with depression. When I look back now those days were horrible and I wonder how did I survive.   I was an active person during my undergrad. Being part of organising events and publications, was something I really enjoyed and did with complete dedication. The first year of masters was quiet compared to the undergrad, but in the second year, I started to be active again. It was by the last months of master, I was diagnosed with depression.   I'm from a developing country and here culture keeps family at a high position. A lot of compromise happen to keep the family from splitting. Things like moving out isn't that easy, because the culture is not in the same way as in developed countries. We are obliged to make compromises in the name of family. Also please bear any mistakes in my language.     Looking back I don't know from which point the life went out of control. I wasn't sleeping properly. I would stay up until like 4 am or 5 am, then I will sleep till noon. I barely ate, and whenever I ate it was unhealthy food in huge quantity. That is when I started to gain weight. What did I lack? May be happiness. Or care from someone. Or some respect from my family. Or a supportive gesture from a stranger.   Life was always difficult. I was sexually abused as a child. It happend for years before somehow I managed to stop it. My abuser is a close relative, who I see still today. I don't talk to him. But his presence makes me upset. My palms get sweaty and I usually walk away. That same abuser made an attempt towards my sister and she managed to avoid it. What cringe me the most is that, my parents still talk to him even after knowing he made an attempt towards my sister. They still believe the family need to be kept intact. They didn't know, until recently that he sexually abused me for a long time.  I didn't open up to my family about the sexual abuse until very recently just, because I don't want to make them sad. I thought I can bear them all. All my personal problems and all the family problems. Everything. I was wrong. I was dead wrong. I always adjusted for others, always for my family, and always put myself, or my heath or my happiness, in the second position. Never in my life I cared about me. I was always the one who can take all the pressure. In every family dispute I stood in the middle, I stayed and invested a lot of my time and energy to set things straight. In the end, when I was down, I had no one to take care of me or support me. Literally no one. Because I was the tough the one.  Did my family support me? Yes, financially. Nothing else. They kept on blaming me for the things I failed to do, events I failed to attend, and the disputes I failed to solve. They blamed me for my failure. Never they considered my side. Never they asked how am I doing now. Never they asked about my health or happiness or my situation. Even after I was diagnosed with depression the support was never there. They don't ask how am I doing now.   Few months back I landed on a very small job. I have been struggling to pull myself together for all these days. Since, the job I got was near to my grandmother's place, I was staying with her. The salary I get is very low. If I convert it to USD, it is around 169 USD per month. Mainly I stayed with my grandma, because of this. She is a bad woman. Hate is her characteristic and she makes the life difficult of people living with her. After a month or so, my father asked me to move out, because grandmother didn't want me around. He didn't consider whether I'm in a position to hold on by myself if I move out, both financially and mentally. I opted for a accommodation provided by my employer, which is more like a Hostel kind of setup. I have been living here since then.   I was deeply hurt by the lack of empathy from my family. They take me for granted. They call me whenever they have a need. Only sister call me to just check on me. I do understand, that many people don't know how to deal with mental health issues. So, when I was asked to move out I wanted to explain my situation to them. I wanted to talk about the sexual abuse I faced and how their attitude of preventing a conflict, shifts the load to my head. But I couldn't open my mouth. I still don't know how to explain all this. So I wrote a 15 page letter to my family and passed it to each of them. Everyone read it. What broke me completely is that they didn't even discuss a word about it. Not even an acknowledgement. I was literally done at that point. For all those things I did for them, I got back only complaints about the things I failed to do.   I really don't know how to deal with them. It is difficult to cut the ties. Im kind of done with them. But, honestly, deep down I still love them. I don't know why. But that is what I feel about them.   Medically speaking my doctor stopped anti depressants few months back. But I struggled to make my sleeping pattern normal. In the past few weeks, I could feel I was going down the spiral again. The same old habits are creeping in and I can't get anywhere near to productive. Two weeks back doctor prescribed the antidepressants again. But my biological rhythm is so fucked that I can't get anything done. I'm sleeping till noon and barely going to work.  I don't think I can hold on by on my own anymore. I was even suicidal during my peak depression days. I had high urge to jump off from heights or moving vehicles. I somehow resisted it because there is always something left to do, to improve. I always wanted to make the lives of people better. I work a lot for that. With one more episode of depression, I really doubt if I will survive. I don't see much left to do now. Life is getting meaningless everyday.  TL;DR: My family don't understand my situation and blames me for the things I failed to do. I can't bear them anymore.

I guess I'm just lonely, and just for anyone to read this would be enough..  I'm honestly holding back tears as i write this. O don't usually give in to being this sad, it just feels like my life has been one long road. I think on how every road comes to an end, so my question becomes.. Do i want it to end?  As by my name if you couldn't tell, it's a gamertag. I love games. Games are my escape from this world, when im in my room alone, in the dark just playing. I don't think about the past anymore, just hurts too much. The pain, i can't control.  I lost my brother 8 years ago, he was my big brother.. A year later my suppose to be dad who didn't really care to be one, died as well.  Now i only have my mom, and she has a disease known as lupus. Autoimmune. Her body destroys itself, she's worked hard and if i could i would take her sickness and die.   Were struggling with bills. The medicine she gets cost a lot, and my work doesn't make enough, however.. Im getting sick as well, doctors say it's hard to diagnose. My mother went undiagnosed until around 28 when she nearly died from her sickness.  She went through mutiple life threatening surgeries, and even doctors are surprised she's lived this long. I'm starting to feel the pressure.  Recently me and my mom helped my grandfather through hospice. We made him comfortable, and stayed by his side as they took him off everything. It was so overwhelming. I didn't want to be there so badly but i promised myself. If anyone i love is dying, I'm going to put on a show. Make them feel comfortable, loved, and show them the conviction in my eyes that everything will be okay. I did that.. I cried in my room, then i would watch motivation videos and work out, shower. Then i would watch him until the sun set. What hurt the most.. After a while they stop opening their eyes, talking, but they move their fingers letting you know theyre listening..fuck. I'm hurting so much inside. So on the last day.. I held his hand and i was crying but i tried to sound so confident. I said"" Everything will be okay grandpa, god is watching over you, there is no darkness, only a warm light around you while our loved ones watch. You're not alone, and like i promised. I'll always be by your side."" It was 6 in the morning. The sun was rising. Surprisingly sunday. I got up and opened the blinds, i told him"" I can tell today is going to be a good day (he would always ask and admire nature outside), the sun is shining and it has a cool breeze."" I laid my hand on his head, and i noticed his breathing became less.  His breaths, longer pauses than before. Finally, he didn't breath again and i waited 3 long minutes. I broke down so hard.. I went to my room and i couldn't stop crying. I thought why is life like this, we grew up poor, and I've lost so much already.  Then i had to be strong as they came for his body, and so came the funeral which we couldn't even pay, so we had to cremate his body. I dont know if thats how you spell it. We didnt have money to bury him next to my grandma and uncles...  Now my mom is all i have left and she's getting sicker, and i am too. My symptoms have worsened. Doctors think i inherited an autoimmune disease also. I can barely pay for her medicine and my body is failing me. We live in some crappy apartments, if its not my body tearing me down, its my mind from the inside. One or the other. I don't let her see these emotions, she has it rough already. I actually pawned my ps4 to give her a good birthday, so i don't have any games to play but i still come here to talk about games. There's so much more that aches me, but it's too much to write. I'll most likely delete this post soon.. In situations that people break down in, scared or just can't handle the emotions. I stand stern and calm. My family asks me how im able to withstand it. I tell them you have to have conviction in what you believe and feel emotions later. Emotions cloud judgement in dangerous situations. The part i never tell them.. Is that my view of the world is dark, and im completely stressed out, i avoid thinking of the past because ill break, i lost most of my talking skills so i dont have any friends, how im haunted by my life events, how even sometimes i want to die.. Does my voice get through..  Its okay if im lonely, dont have friends, money, i just wanted to live peacefully with the ones i love the most. They're all leaving me, soon ill be alone.  What will this life be worth without them by my side.. I pray god takes me after my mom goes, i dont think i want to live any longer. The pain is too much to endure and the sickness is eating me alive and i cant breathe, im reaching my limits!  Okay, im going to stop now.. I cant even cry for long, This is just a partial stort of my life, one that will ultimately fade because life continues forward.. I know were all faces our challenges. I wish all of you the best out there..",0.9356,positive,anxious

I've talked to my professors for advice and they all told me that I should just focus on my studies first (since I study in the top uni in my country) and that the tuition is free so I don't need to work anyway. I have quite a shallow reason for wanting to have a job - it's because I want to buy myself stuff with my own money.   I am a scholar and so I receive bi-annually stipend. But money just disappears so easily! I spend it mostly for transportation (dorm would be even more expensive), for buying food for my mom, dad, and sister to eat out in fancy places, as a treat, and I also like buying a couple of clothes every now and then as a treat for myself for working my ass off even though I have really bad mental health without getting treatment because I simply can't even afford consulting a psychiatrist about it. And I knew that even if I could afford consulting a doctor, I know the meds would be really expensive.   Right now I can't even fix my life because I'm too poor to go out with people and literally don't have time to date / hang out with people because I spend 3 hours traveling daily and I spend practically all day at university. I don't have time anymore. As I've said I study in a top uni and so the workload here is pretty hellish.

If I settled for honors classes and just one club, so that way I could still have fun.

I'm have bipolar disorder which I've been dealing with for the past 10 years and recently I stopped smoking weed and going to group therapy.. I'm taking my meds and going to group three times a week. I feel like I'm trying to keep myself busy and be patient... ugh I hate that phrase... but I still feel in the fog. I'm worried I'm ruining my marriage to a man who is nothing but supportive and I feel like I'm always going to feel like I'm living in black and white. like nothing is satisfying, like I'm looking at the world through a cage and don't know how to get out. I've been suicidal in the past but never really wanting to die, just terrified of forever being stuck in this mundane and depressed existence..

569,depression_help,Not sure if I should go back to therapy/a doctor,koicartel,1.0,"So bit of an overview; I'm 17 years old right now but I've been struggling with depression since I was around 11. I developed anorexia nervosa at the age of 14 and that + worsening depression culminated in 5 weeks in an intensive adolescent psych ward following a suicide attempt when I was 15.  I'm weight restored and though I still struggle with frequent ED-related thoughts, I'm a lot better than I used to be and I'm doing ok at keeping things together in that respect.  I was initially put on fluoxetine for the depression, then sertraline after fluoxetine didn't work. Sertraline fucked with me a lot and made me way more suicidal, so I was quickly switched to citalopram and quetiapine (which helps me sleep, though isn't working so much anymore because I've been taking it every night for quite a while).    I broke off a toxic relationship just over a year ago which made things a lot brighter and between then and now things have been ok 95% of the time; I won a scholarship to spend a month touring around Germany, I've been riding and racing motorcycles which I love, and spending lots of time with all my friends, whom I adore. I'm moving to Germany in January, first to work as an au pair and then to study, my grades are really good, and objectively everything in my life is great, but I struggle a lot (and even more so recently) with finding a reason in living.  I constantly ask myself what the point of life is at all, if I will ever have some kind of significant role in life, why I'm even bothering to do anything when life is so temporary and we all just end up forgotten at the end of it anyway. Sure there's finding a rewarding career and stuff like that but everything feels so monotonous to me; I just finished 13 years of school, I'm going to be doing 6+ years at university and then however many years at work until I retire and just wait around til I die. I have very little motivation to do anything and I'm finding myself consumed more and more by envy of other people and their successes, wanting to find my own drive and passion in- and for- life again.   I'm not sure if this is depression coming back or just a bit of an existential crisis, but everything seems pretty bleak at the moment. I'm hesitant to see a psychologist, counsellor etc since that would involve telling my parents about all this, and they didn't take things very well last time I was in this kind of state, + with the hospital and everything. I know they want to help but the way they respond to this kind of thing is and was so distressing, and I also don't want them to start thinking that I shouldn't go to Germany since that's my main beacon of hope.   I really don't know what to do at the moment; do I just try to wait all this out til I get to Germany and hope that everything rights itself there or do I try and address it now in case it gets worse? I feel like I'm rotting   **tl;dr- been depressed since I was 11, tried to kms when I was 15 (now 17), things were ok since around last july/august to now but recently I feel like I've developed into an edgy tumblr nihilist and I'm struggling to find any kind of motivation or meaning in life at all. I'm a little reluctant to see a psych/counsellor because my parents get real spooked and tend to flip out, and I'm not sure if moving to Germany in January (which has been my dream for ages) will make everything better on its own or if I should try address this now in case it gets worse and I fuck over my chances.** ",0.9228,positive,lonely,1,1

9854,depression_help,Left wondering,myrrh2,1.0,"This may be a long post lol. Anyways I am a pretty young guy 23 years old and is currently enlisted in the armed forces. My girlfriend and I recently broke up and it honestly crushed my soul, we were dating for 5 months long distance(with a few instances where we were physically together) but I've known her for around 5.  She has dealt with depression for a long time and I have known based on the stories she has told me but it didn't stop me from loving the hell out of her. She would say she's crazy but I would see how amazing she really was. Of course there were some disagreements and we had some arguments but it never made me think, ""Damn she really is crazy""! Honestly those 5 months of being with her were the absolute best months of my life, she is so caring and affectionate, she has shown me so much adventure and great times. We actually enjoyed each others company and we felt we could say anything to each other.  She told me in the first few weeks of dating me it already was deeper than her last year long relationship. In my honest opinion and the opinion of others her last boyfriends were complete assholes, and it feels weird to me that she would leave someone that actually cared deeply about her and would stay by her side in the toughest of times. But when I said that I was willing to stay with her and support her she said she did not want me to wait for her, if I stayed that it would cause her to feel resentment. She keeps repeatedly telling me that she caused me pain and that she cant talk to me because she cant deal with my pain and that she isn't that great of a person to hold onto in the first place; she wanted space. But she was the light of my life and it hurts when I read those words.  Now onto my side of the story I guess. Since I'm in the armed forces its already stressful enough and being long distance adds to the stress but I bare it because I love the hell out of this girl. I just don't feel as if I'm getting any better by being where I am right now. My body is banged up and I'm about to be medboarded out of the military which would be a blessing because I can then follow my dreams. I've been banged up for about a year now and even the medical staff thinks its best for me to get separated out.  I've been in limbo for awhile with this, I feel like I cant plan my future until I know I'm being medboarded (if I'm staying in the military or not) and its been stressing me out. I felt that if I was separated from the military that it would definitely benefit the relationship with my significant other since I would feel like I gained my freedom and manhood back. To not be burdened by all of the restrictions and restraints placed on me. This place really took its toll on me and I feel it leaked out into the relationship but I tried to make her understand how hard it is out here where I am stationed and on top of that not being able to perform my duties due to my broken body.  I wanted to talk to her because just the simple act of communicating with her made my day. Sometimes I felt as if I was somewhat neglected and that she was pushing me away, she realized that maybe sometimes she was being selfish, but I don't fault her for that anymore I understand where she is coming from. She would isolate herself due to the depression and push everyone away, but it was hard for me because I had no way of knowing she was feeling down until I would ask and wonder if she was ok. During the early stages of long distance it did get me down since I would just feel like shit when we didn't talk much during the day, and she thought I needed her to be happy but its just the fact that I wanted to chat sometimes. It got a lot better after awhile I realized I had to calm down and I did. There were a few times where I felt that she was misunderstanding me (which she did lol) and I would have to explain myself. I think these moments and mixed with depression and other things caused her to feel as if she was causing me pain all the time.  When she let me go she said she wanted me to be in a healthy and happier relationship but she doesn't understand that I am truly happy with her and Id do anything to stay with her and see to it that she gets the help that she wants! She keeps saying that she's not that great of a person anyways, that she was too hard on me sometimes and for me to just let go like this never happened. It fucking kills me inside. Id do anything for this girl because I'm just that type of person with anyone. She would tell me that time heals all wounds which it does but I don't like the fact that it sounds so permanent, its a decision she made thinking its the best for me but only I can decide what's best for me in the end. I'm not putting up with her depression and the pain that comes with it sometimes. I CHOOSE to, I've grown more understanding of it and tried to change myself to where I would just give her space, but I was still happy with her.  There were positives to the breakup and some negatives lol. I realized the love I have for myself and my goals. I was able to look at the relationship we had from a birds eye view for the first time. I realized that even though she was telling me to let her go because she was too harsh, I couldn't because I cant hate anyone especially her. Instead of hate I felt an even stronger sense of love and sense of caring for her, thinking back on all the memories we created while we were physically in each others presence, all of the deep conversations we have had, her amazing laugh and energy and it kills me to think she wants me to let go of that forever. I want to be by her side and text her that but I have to respect the space that she wants so she can work on herself. She said she was sorry for starting a relationship with me that she couldn't finish due to her problems. I wanted to be with her through thick and thin but she sees it as me just waiting around for her and she doesn't want me to do that. I just wish she could see into my mind to know how I felt about her still and that I want to be by her side to support her.  Do you think she will ever reach out to me and consider getting back together because this girl is a god damn angel to me and an inspiration, it just hurts that depression has taken its hold and I hope she gets better because she deserves to. It would hurt if she just forgot about me and just forgot about all the good times we did have. I miss this girl so much and love and care for her.

She’s emo and I wasn’t she wore all black and I was just a normal guy that has fun and had a great personality. While I was with her I had really good times and all I can do is remember those times. I can’t let go. One day we got into a big argument and I already knew what she was gonna do after we finished arguing so I told her don’t do it and she acted like I didn’t know but then I said don’t cut yourself and she promised she wouldn’t. The next day I see her I hug her and kiss her and apologized for how stupid I was being then I told her to let me see her arm and she said no so I pulled back her sleeve to see all these cuts. It felt like I got shot right in the chest. I felt so dumb because she cut herself because of me. I went home that day and started to burst out in tears and then I just grabbed a razor and did it myself. I realized from that day that I changed who I was I don’t see myself as a joyful guy anymore I just see myself as a pathetic waste of space and a waste of time. If I had her here today with me I wouldn’t need to cut I wouldn’t have depression but she’s gone. I still hold on to the hats she wore and gave to me. I still have our pictures together.

4576,depression_help,My depression,Calisso,2.0,"Please don't feel so bad about it! And please (!!) stop cutting yourself while you can.   It's not your fault that she cutted herself after your argument primary. She has, or had, a serious mental problem and that's not because of you. She took your trust and decided to throw it away, not you!  I bet she would have cutted herself in an argument with others too. It isn't nice to think about it that way but if you realise it, you will get over it. She was not ready to quit, there was nothing you could do about it 'cause in the first place, she has to want it.  Someday she will think about cutting herself and that there is a way and so will you! Compensate your anger and disappointment with sports, meditation, reading and talk about your feelings over and over. You will never forget what happened but you'll understand and learn from it.   As you said, there is a happy and nice person in you and it's still there! I am sure that one day there will be a girl that can appreciate you and doesn't manipulate you that way your ex did.

They go from bad to worse to anxiety attack back to bad again. I did try working as an Uber driver for a while. Kind of a terrible job for me since I'm not good with being around people. But I was technically self employed. I was able to work on my better days and stay home when it got to be too much. I may actually try going back to that.",-0.9486,negative,surprised,1,1

I've had about ten jobs in the last two years, they were all a month long so I have no references as I usually don't even go in to quit, either just quit by phone or e mail which is just not cool.

510,depression_help,Benefits or work?,hiimmrmiseeks,6.0,I know what you mean. Knowing that you are going to have to be some kind of miraculous social butterfly on a specific day is just almost impossible. There's no way you can know what's going to happen or how you are going to feel. Sometimes you just can't handle it and unfortunately for people like us that's just life. On a possible long shot do you have any other make up artist friends? Perhaps you could book events like weddings together and if life gets to be too much the day you are supposed to work your friend could just do the gig solo so you wouldn't end up cancelling on the bride. Just a thought.,0.8203,positive,grateful,1,1
510,depression_help,Benefits or work?,crumbsinmahbed,7.0,"Aw, that's actually a really good idea. I don't have any make up artist friends but that's just a good idea in general for any kind of self employment or small business kind of thing.

8069,depression_help,Student in dire need for motivation,Aenarion21,1.0,"Hello. Like many others that come here, I need help. Or I think I need it. Or I need someone to tell me how to help myself.  &amp;#x200B;  I’m a student, 26 years old, currently working on my thesis (on human reliability analysis \[HRA\]) for my mechanical engineering degree. I really like this career. I have studied it for years, and though it hasn’t been easy, and I had some courses I really disliked, I passed every one of them. There were semesters where I spent most of my weekends at the university, where I didn’t see my friends for months and I slept like 2-hours most days; but I liked it there: the pressure, the difficult tests and all (mine is one of the top engineering universities in my country). After finishing my courses, I started working on a thesis about fluid mechanics and heat transfer, heavily focused on simulation of turbulent flow. I liked it. Before going for engineering, I thought about getting into science. And this felt like science, it was a cutting-edge investigation, heavily funded. But I couldn’t finish it. Suddenly, I didn’t have the structure of periodic test and a schedule to keep at uni. I had more “free” time that I knew what to do with it. But also, I started having problems with my thesis, specifically, I didn’t have the pc necessary to do the complicated simulations I needed to get my results. My Thesis Supervisor wanted to help but couldn’t get me the pc I needed, although he tried.  &amp;#x200B;  During this period, depression hit me hard, and I let this go on for several months. When I finally got myself to talk and tell everything to my Thesis Supervisor, I had already lost a year of my life. He understood completely, he was very supportive and kind, but I just couldn’t work on any thing related to fluid mechanics again, which was his area.  &amp;#x200B;  After that, and not long ago, I went to another professor, with whom I could be friends with (I think), if we weren’t student and professor and didn’t have so much age difference. Anyway, he understood what I went trough and offered me another thesis, on HRA, on which I’m currently working. This was a little before the holidays, and he encouraged me to travel or something, to clear my head. But now I’m back, and I must schedule a meeting with him soon.  &amp;#x200B;  Beside this, I have to tell you about my personal life. After a long while single, I have a girlfriend now, we have been together for some time and it’s going great. This relationship is my peace of mind and source of happiness. But my life at home isn’t great. We are not doing well on money and my parents fight a lot. They are also tidiness maniacs, which I’ve always hated. We have talked several times, and I know I’m not young, I should be working right now, and I think many of my mood problems would go away if I was living on my own, or with friends. But to do that, I need to finish my thesis, and I can’t find the will to do that. I thought the source of my depression was the hard times at university, and that it got worse when I couldn’t finish my previous thesis; but now, after I got another investigation topic and even after some great holidays with my girlfriend, I still can’t seem to find the will to do the research, to write about what I have read. Instead, I play some stupid game on my smartphone or watch series on Netflix. I don’t even like playing games too much or staying in bed until late, but still every time I try to work, I get sleepy, I play without really enjoying the game, or lose my time on memes or other web pages I don’t really care that much about anyway. Seems like anything goes before what I really have to do, but in my mind I’m all too conscious about what I have to do, yet it’s like I’m hitting an invisible wall every time I open my thesis.  &amp;#x200B;  First, I thought I would feel better when I got past the difficult courses at uni. Then I thought I would get better after changing my thesis. I thought I would feel better having a partner. Even when things with my family are perfect, I don’t feel so good.  I know this is not as bad as other people’s situation. I know I could be doing a lot worse, but I don’t need that right now. I need to find a way to motivate myself to read and to write.  &amp;#x200B;  I’m not sure what I came looking for here, but maybe I just needed to write this whole thing down and hope someone would understand and say something helpful. Or maybe just posting this post, will help me understand myself a little bit better.",0.998,positive,guilty,1,1
8069,depression_help,Student in dire need for motivation,gravity_grave_87,2.0,"Hi there.   Your post really resonated with me. I'm currently on a break from my PhD because I ended up with the exact same 'invisible wall' months ago, after going through a really rough time. I still can't check my e-mails without drinking a substantial amount which numbs the anxiety. I get nauseous every time I have to use my old USB stick because I can see my thesis-related files on there. Relationships-wise, my life is fine.   What you're describing and the closest word to what I have been experiencing is trauma. And I don't think it even needs to be PTSD levels of trauma to cause severe distress. Perhaps it's the frustration of going into your first project all wide-eyed and excited and ending up not completing it (for whatever reason). Perhaps it's something completely unrelated which you were struggling with and weren't aware of at the time. Plus there's the added pressure of your current home situation - I did feel a massive improvement when I moved out of my old flat, which I hated with a passion and only reminded me of really bad times.   Either way, are you seeing a therapist? Are they helping at all? If not, you should definitely consider it. Good luck x ",-0.9433,negative,grateful,1,1
8069,depression_help,Student in dire need for motivation,Aenarion21,3.0,"Thanks for posting, fellow redditor.   Actually, trauma does make sense.  Just writing my post help a bit, I feel a bit better than yesterday, if not any more motivated. But maybe understanding this thing a bit more in depth will help me deal with it.",0.6759,positive,surprised,1,1
