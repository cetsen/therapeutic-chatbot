618,MentalHealthSupport,Anyone else frustrated by this?,RoseBunny8,1,"So I posted yesterday that I'm in a relapse of my depression. Today was a lot better than yesterday, which is good.   I'm just wondering if anyone else gets frustrated when people/friends say something to the effect of ""oh I understand needing mental health days"" or ""I've been depressed sometimes too""?  Like I get theyre trying to be helpful and relate to me but having life long depression where every day your fighting your own brain is not the same as needing a ""mental health day"".   Yes I'm doing better today, but better here does not mean I'm all good and everything is solved. It means that I'm having a relatively good day where I can stay awake for more than an hour at a time and it doesnt feeling like every waking moment my brain is not telling me to kill myself or how much I suck.   How does everyone else respond to these well meaning ""I get it"" messages when you really feel like they don't? Do you just smile and nod or try to help them truly understand?",0.9436,positive,joyful,1,1

1340,MentalHealthSupport,I have to keep myself busy to not get sad but the stress from not relaxing is taking a toll on me.,TerryCrewsLovesYaoi,1,"Im 18 and currently in highschool. I enjoy it but it's tough so I study a lot at home in order to keep my grades up.I also work part time at a fast food restaurant and I'm currently in training to become a manager which is very exciting and would be great to have on my resume so I'm working very hard. Often 25-35 hour weeks. There are also a bunch of tests and things that I have to do at home in order to become a verified manager so my days are usually packed.  I'm also doing what I can to finish homework and get passing grades in school. I promised myself before I took the job a year ago that I can't let it get in the way of my education.  Over all I work and study for a total of 70-90 hours every week and have done so for a few months (not counting the summer ofc). I have fun at work and school and I finish things in time but I have noticed myself becoming tired, sad and stressed whenever I have free time. I also fear I'm no longer fun to be with because of my lack of energy and whenever I'm in social situations outside of school and work, I become tired and sorta quite fast. Whenever I'm by myself watching TV or playing video games or whatever I do to relax, I get anxiety and become super stressed. This started happening a few months ago but it's been gradually becoming worse.  Whenever I actually get an opportunity to relax, I feel myself becoming stressed and sad so I find something else to do. I'm now always trying to keep myself busy in order to not get anxious but not taking the time to sleep and relax is obviously making the stress worse.  I feel like I'm in a bad loop where I have to keep myself busy all the time but I'm stressed out over not having enough time to relax.  I haven't talked to anybody about this. Any advice is appreciated!  Thank you.",0.5572,positive,anticipating,1,1

1048,MentalHealthSupport,I'm getting a bit worried,ChocoMilk996,1,"Hello, everyone. Is it normal for me to pick at my skin multiple times a day? I have acne and I can't get my hands off my face or even the rest of my body. I pick at my scabs to the point of drawing blood sometimes and it's strange but oddly satisfying in a way. It's caused me a lot of scarring and I think it only makes the picking worse. I had a similar habit in the past as a kid when I would pluck out my hair and eyelashes, but I eventually controlled those urges. I find that playing games keeps my hands occupied but not for long.

1048,MentalHealthSupport,I'm getting a bit worried,hpnerd2,2,"Hello! It may just be a bad habit, but there’s also a name for a mental illness for this. (I’m a psych major so I’ve studied it before in college). The name of it is Excoriation disorder. It may help to research it. BUT if it is just a habit, I’ve had it as one (never the disorder). For me, I had to self examine to see why I was doing it. I learned it as a coping skill when my anxiety got too much. Whenever I noticed it happening, I told myself to stop. Over time, it got easier. I tended to do it on my arms and fingers so I wear longer sleeves and paint my nails really nice too. So for your face, you could try makeup or just being proud of a really good skin routine.

670,MentalHealthSupport,Pyromania?..,_HiddenMask_,1,"I have recently spoken to a phsyciatrist (forced :) about these issues and he recommended admitting me into a hospital out of safety reasons. Of course because of pricing being high we couldn't really say no or yes until we're sure it's absolutely necessary.   So lately for the past what.. About a month or two? I've been using fire as an outlet. Burning things began with candles and went onto paper, then notebooks, and now books as large as dictionaries. I won't really go into detail on emotions during the moments, but I know it helps. Sometimes it's difficult to hold back heavy urges to burn myself or others. Though holding back didn't work very long and I now have marks from either dripping hot wax onto myself or holding my hand above flames.   My mother and friends have called me names because of it..

I’ve been getting low grades no matter how hard I try, I suffering from limitations. To make it worse I spend most of my time by myself at school and kept up in the solitude of my room. And yeah it’s lonely, I’m an introvert but I’m just so damn lonely. I know that I have a girlfriend who loves me but why isn’t she here when I need her the most. I don’t blame her I just wish I could just let her know, if I do, I don’t know if she’ll listen or care and that’s what I’m scared about. That’s why I can’t message her. I’m scared even more because if I’m not open with communication in my relationship I risk losing her. I don’t know what to do I’m lost (mentally) and im scared and yet again I have no one to talk to. I don’t want to have another depressive season, it’s one of the most important years, year 12, for me. It reflects my future career.

They don’t tell you about all the 3am breakdowns you’ll endure, or how everything seems worse at night. They tell you, you may loose your appetite. They don’t tell you about the days that you don’t even have the energy to eat, or how sick food can make you feel. They tell you, you’ll be tired sometimes. They don’t tell you how it doesn’t matter how much you sleep you’ll always feel exhausted, or that some days you’ll be so tired even brushing your hair is a mountain to climb. They tell you, you may become distant from others. They don’t tell you it’s because you feel unworthy enough to enjoy the company of others, or how sometimes you just can’t face the world. They tell you, you might feel the need to harm yourself. They don’t tell you about the shame you feel as you purposely hurt your body, or the need to have some control over your life as it spirals - even if that way is inflicting pain.

The only thing that seems to work these days is sticking on YouTube or an audiobook and shutting my eyes. The talking makes my mind listen, and if it's something I've seen/heard a million times before, it knocks me out within an hour or two, which is practically miraculous for me. I'm not a professional, or any kind of sleep expert, just someone who suffers with severe intrusive thoughts.

398,MentalHealthSupport,Ovwhelmed and lack of motivation,fake_zealer,1,"I have a lot going on in my life. I'm 17 years old and I'm currently in foster care. I just got admitted to university this past week, I'm struggling with a couple of my highschool classes, and I'm dealing with the trauma of my past. (You gotta be in foster care for a reason.)   I've been in foster care for over a while (it'll be a year in march) and I say I've been handling things pretty well. I have only had less than a handful of instances where I broke down and cried.   But since I got admitted into university all of that has pretty much changed. I've been hit full on in the face with reality and its super hard. I've found that I have no real motivation for life other than ensuring my future happens. It's hard for me to get homework done and for me to keep trudging on.   I've just been so overwhelmed that I'm really depressed and have been feeling suicidal. I'm barely holding onto my sanity by a mere few threads.   Like just tonight, I had finished cooking dinner for my family and I sat down to eat. I had my headphones on and was watching youtube. But my foster mom a few feet away was shrillingily talking super loud. She just wouldn't shut up and it just sent me over the brim. (Plus my younger sister was just super sassy with me.) I ended up rushing up the stairs only to cry my eyes out, totally freaked out.  Normally shit like that wouldn't upset me but the noise just totally overwhelmed me.  I have a good relationship with my foster parents and I'm normally super open to talking with them, but I'm scared to mention the suicidal part to my foster parents because that is taken super seriously.   I just don't know what to do. I'm currently in therapy but its biweekly and doesn't do much. Does anyone have any advice for finding motivation as well as helping with the overwhelming feeling?

7945,Anxietyhelp,[13] fit teen. Weird sensation when surprised or excited.,Fluffy_Charge_59,1,Hey I’ve been having anxiety for a while ever since qurantine started. It started when I was lying down weird and I felt something drop in my throat. It ended up being silent reflux. And I’ve been taking a powdered  ant acid that I put in water  however I’ve been kinda slacking since I don’t take it everyday. I’m on and off about it because I still have some days to go with it but it’s pretty much fixed. It did come back once but I took the medicine again and after a day of taking it and drinking water it went away again.  Then I started getting ringing in the ears but that was due to anxiety too because once I stopped getting stressed about it it went away     But with this. Even after I’m not being stressed about it it can randomly hit me. Idk maybe it’s because when I get excited sometimes I think about it while I’m still excited or surprised and it hits quick. Making me think it just randomly happened. But yea I’ve spoken to some online doctor and he also said it was anxiety. It usually happens the most at night when I’m very sleepy. That’s why I’ve been trying to go to sleep before I get insanely sleepy or else I will get those panic attacks which give me those sensations.ive also been getting the skipping of heart feeling too sometimes. My parents said that’s normal as well but it’s been happening a lot. It didn’t happen that much today until I got stressed again.   I’m pretty much 100% that it’s anxiety because all this time I was relaxed it barely happened and when it did I was sure it was from post anxiety still trying to heal. And again it only happens a lot when I’m stressed not much when I’m relaxed.  Plus I’m on my 13 and I’m in shape. I guess I’m just looking for these comments to ease it.     Also question. Can doing something intense cause chest pain or aching? Because before I did that intense thing my chest wasn’t getting a zap and wasn’t having slight pain. I just don’t want this to build up. And I really don’t want to get on medications or therapy because every time I’ve had anxiety of some sort I’ve fixed it myself or my family fixed it. The zap feeling is probably the least common of them I think it only happened 2 times.  But the slight pain doesn’t even hurt that much hurts less than a pinch.

4085,Anxietyhelp,How should I set up my own boundaries to friends who have depression too and want to vent?,Spiderbendy,1,"I love my friends so dearly but I’m now working on myself in therapy and learning CBT so I finally was honest with myself.   I wear myself thin. I get borderline anxiety any time they vent to me, because more often than not, I am not equipped to help them. I can listen but I don’t know how to give advice or even what Comfort Words ™ to say. But I’ve heard/seen that in order to be a good friend, you have to be there for their highs and lows. So I figured I Had to be available for them to vent anytime they needed? But I get into this mode of “I Have To Help Them” regardless of how I immediately stress out since I know one wrong word can make them feel worse or I could give them bad advice.   I suppose I need to be working on myself to be able to be there for friends, cuz it’s not their fault I stress myself by over thinking.   So I think my overall question is, what is a healthy friendship? Should I be putting up such a harsh boundary of Never venting to me? (*My mother forces me to hear her vents 24/7 so it wears me down, then to add my friends who are in way more difficult situations, makes me feel almost responsible for them too*)  Have any of you had this experience?",0.9229999999999999,positive,anxious,1,1
4085,Anxietyhelp,How should I set up my own boundaries to friends who have depression too and want to vent?,abuffalonickle,2,"Oh love, your heart is in the right place, but that place is how we got here. And I say “we” because I am the same way. It is in fact the healthiest of relationships that are honest. It’s hard to tell your friends you have nothing left in the tank to give cause you’re barely hanging on yourself. Truly hard. Because we are the “strong” ones. And at least for me, I held myself to that standard always.... until I broke. Doesn’t make you any less strong, doesn’t make you weak, but it does make you HUMAN! None of us can carry everyone’s loads, and it’s not fair to tell yourself you can and if these people are your friends they will understand. Vulnerability is hard, but that conversation will relieve you of a “responsibility” that truly isn’t yours alone. Be honest. With your friends and most importantly yourself. You can’t do it all, all the time my friend. 10/10 your friends want you at your best, and if they understood how you felt they would get it. You are human, and you are loved for being that.

I've been here a year basically I'm having horrible work anxiety to the point where I'm having trouble getting out of bed. As I'm laying here at 10:45 am,  I have work at 2 and it's seriously affecting my mental health at this point  Back story  We sell shoes of course, my shift is from 2-7,today and tomorrow Yesterday I felt the same and had to convince myself not to ghost my job or call out It doesn't pay well. 10$ an hour, my checks are about 5.% of my actual money, but we do have a 50% discount which is great  At this point, that's all I want. I'm not passionate about the work  I get uncomfortable here for a number of reasons: The temperature is very cold, low 60s always, my body temp gets confused. I get hot/cold for hours and can't control it Poor scheduling I've tried to change my availability and nobody has listened to me My manager is nice but on her terms, I don't think she will give a fuck about my mental health and will fire me if I cant work at 100% for any reason They are very concerned with performance but don't communicate well  Vibe of the store is very depressing to me I'm now so anxious it's making me physically sick  and I'm not allowed to switch shifts with people!    I feel so hurt and guilty, yesterday I was an emotional mess inside and couldn't work fully. I was late by half hour, scared to walk into work,icouldn't focus on the register and I created a long line by accident,luckily my one manager cares about me and let me go home an hour early.  We are understaffed because vans hates to hire new people and its so much pressure when really its not paying us much at all.   My other jobs i can work on my own time, and I'm waiting to start a new job in the cannabis dispensary..  My family and friends love my discount and I do love being able to get shoes but I feel I can't do this anymore  What do I do?

I am a Psychology student and the dissertation is on the effect sleep disturbances on mental health (including anxiety, depression and suicidal behaviours).   There is a mass of evidence showing how taking part in studies on mental health is beneficial for those who are suffering (Gibson, Boden, Benson, &amp; Brand, 2014, Wong, Kwok, Michel, &amp; Wong, 2017), it has also been seen to greatly reduce suicidal ideation.

I was happy  I thought everything will be back to normal, however since then he keeps going with my other friends and they never call me if they go out, it became that my friends only answer me if I call them and they never call me, I keep getting anxious non stop that I am out of the group and that my friend is trying to seperate me. I became so anxious I cannot sleep many times and I feel my heartbeat becoming fast for a long period of time.

6822,depressed,Self isolation has got me down...,Darkerfaerie,2,Have you talked to your boyfriend about it? Is he willing to help you motivate yourself so you can start getting back on track?   One thing that helps me get out of bed when my husband is home is when he tells me he wants to be with me but that he won't come to bed. Its endearing and helps motivate me to get my ass out of bed.   Try to find some reason to do things. And dont worry about how much or how big it is.

I feel like I'm behind a mask and I just smile and look pretty just so that I can get through a conversation. I want to show my emotions here and not be judged.  I'm a Junior in high school and I now have 2 weeks off. I'm attracted to this girl in my English class and I'm worried that I'm never going to see her again. I never really talked to her and she never really talked to me. I don't want to miss a chance to get to know her. There's no real solution now and I've thought of everything.  My school friends are not helping either. I feel like they are slowly drifting away. Most of my friends I originally made in 8th grade are either gone, or have broken off due to disagreements. My only two remaining friends are slowly drifting away. One of them is no longer in school most of the time due to social issues and my other friend now spends most of his time with his girlfriend. I'm not blaming them for their social issues or having a girlfriend, I just feel like I'm being spoiled by saying that my friends are starting to not care about me.  I just want to lie on the ground and breathe right now. I don't want my life to get cut short just because of a few shitty moments. I want to go back to 8th grade when responsibilities like applying for college and driving weren't there and my friend group was actually there for me. This is the first time I've felt depressed and it really started hitting me hard in January and it's been on and off ever since.  I don't want to invite friends over because then it feels like a chore to talk and not just do my own thing. I can't make new friends now because I'm trapped in my house. I just want someone who can be there for me (and I can be there for them).

The past 3 years were getting slowly better. Everything the past 6 months have been fantastic! Up and coming me and the lady's 3rd year, school going better, finally losing weight, everything just felt better. Then... since the last 2 weeks have been shitty. I can see it when she talks to me she's disinterested. Hasn't texted me in those 2 weeks, along with her seeming distant since Valentine's Day, but I didn't wanna believe it. School has been getting harder since people don't seem interested in talking to me. Not even the one teacher who enjoyed my company. Both my parents enjoy the company of my sisters better since they got kids. They don't talk with me ever anymore. Everything feels like it's falling apart and I feel like I did something wrong. 2nd night of sleeping alone and I hate it. That pain in my gut of being alone has come back and I hate it. I look in the mirror and I hate it. I think she might be ready to leave me. Everyone else has lost faith in me or has dropped any sort of relationship so why stick around me? I've been staring at my gun the past few nights waiting for her to tell me she's leaving. Wake up to either a note in my room or a text. I'm about to lose everything and I just want to cry and end it because it feels like I somehow fucked everything up with family and friends and I don't wanna be alone again with nothing. I attempted suicide a few months before meeting her. Ever since I had her in my life I never wanted to. I feel like if she leaves and that connection is gone I might just snap.

5368,depressed,I'm done with my family and can't bear them anymore,sorter_plainview,1,"It's been a year and half since I diagnosed with depression. When I look back now those days were horrible and I wonder how did I survive.   I was an active person during my undergrad. Being part of organising events and publications, was something I really enjoyed and did with complete dedication. The first year of masters was quiet compared to the undergrad, but in the second year, I started to be active again. It was by the last months of master, I was diagnosed with depression.   I'm from a developing country and here culture keeps family at a high position. A lot of compromise happen to keep the family from splitting. Things like moving out isn't that easy, because the culture is not in the same way as in developed countries. We are obliged to make compromises in the name of family. Also please bear any mistakes in my language.     Looking back I don't know from which point the life went out of control. I wasn't sleeping properly. I would stay up until like 4 am or 5 am, then I will sleep till noon. I barely ate, and whenever I ate it was unhealthy food in huge quantity. That is when I started to gain weight. What did I lack? May be happiness. Or care from someone. Or some respect from my family. Or a supportive gesture from a stranger.   Life was always difficult. I was sexually abused as a child. It happend for years before somehow I managed to stop it. My abuser is a close relative, who I see still today. I don't talk to him. But his presence makes me upset. My palms get sweaty and I usually walk away. That same abuser made an attempt towards my sister and she managed to avoid it. What cringe me the most is that, my parents still talk to him even after knowing he made an attempt towards my sister. They still believe the family need to be kept intact. They didn't know, until recently that he sexually abused me for a long time.  I didn't open up to my family about the sexual abuse until very recently just, because I don't want to make them sad. I thought I can bear them all. All my personal problems and all the family problems. Everything. I was wrong. I was dead wrong. I always adjusted for others, always for my family, and always put myself, or my heath or my happiness, in the second position. Never in my life I cared about me. I was always the one who can take all the pressure. In every family dispute I stood in the middle, I stayed and invested a lot of my time and energy to set things straight. In the end, when I was down, I had no one to take care of me or support me. Literally no one. Because I was the tough the one.  Did my family support me? Yes, financially. Nothing else. They kept on blaming me for the things I failed to do, events I failed to attend, and the disputes I failed to solve. They blamed me for my failure. Never they considered my side. Never they asked how am I doing now. Never they asked about my health or happiness or my situation. Even after I was diagnosed with depression the support was never there. They don't ask how am I doing now.   Few months back I landed on a very small job. I have been struggling to pull myself together for all these days. Since, the job I got was near to my grandmother's place, I was staying with her. The salary I get is very low. If I convert it to USD, it is around 169 USD per month. Mainly I stayed with my grandma, because of this. She is a bad woman. Hate is her characteristic and she makes the life difficult of people living with her. After a month or so, my father asked me to move out, because grandmother didn't want me around. He didn't consider whether I'm in a position to hold on by myself if I move out, both financially and mentally. I opted for a accommodation provided by my employer, which is more like a Hostel kind of setup. I have been living here since then.   I was deeply hurt by the lack of empathy from my family. They take me for granted. They call me whenever they have a need. Only sister call me to just check on me. I do understand, that many people don't know how to deal with mental health issues. So, when I was asked to move out I wanted to explain my situation to them. I wanted to talk about the sexual abuse I faced and how their attitude of preventing a conflict, shifts the load to my head. But I couldn't open my mouth. I still don't know how to explain all this. So I wrote a 15 page letter to my family and passed it to each of them. Everyone read it. What broke me completely is that they didn't even discuss a word about it. Not even an acknowledgement. I was literally done at that point. For all those things I did for them, I got back only complaints about the things I failed to do.   I really don't know how to deal with them. It is difficult to cut the ties. Im kind of done with them. But, honestly, deep down I still love them. I don't know why. But that is what I feel about them.   Medically speaking my doctor stopped anti depressants few months back. But I struggled to make my sleeping pattern normal. In the past few weeks, I could feel I was going down the spiral again. The same old habits are creeping in and I can't get anywhere near to productive. Two weeks back doctor prescribed the antidepressants again. But my biological rhythm is so fucked that I can't get anything done. I'm sleeping till noon and barely going to work.  I don't think I can hold on by on my own anymore. I was even suicidal during my peak depression days. I had high urge to jump off from heights or moving vehicles. I somehow resisted it because there is always something left to do, to improve. I always wanted to make the lives of people better. I work a lot for that. With one more episode of depression, I really doubt if I will survive. I don't see much left to do now. Life is getting meaningless everyday.  TL;DR: My family don't understand my situation and blames me for the things I failed to do. I can't bear them anymore.

I guess I'm just lonely, and just for anyone to read this would be enough..  I'm honestly holding back tears as i write this. O don't usually give in to being this sad, it just feels like my life has been one long road. I think on how every road comes to an end, so my question becomes.. Do i want it to end?  As by my name if you couldn't tell, it's a gamertag. I love games. Games are my escape from this world, when im in my room alone, in the dark just playing. I don't think about the past anymore, just hurts too much. The pain, i can't control.  I lost my brother 8 years ago, he was my big brother.. A year later my suppose to be dad who didn't really care to be one, died as well.  Now i only have my mom, and she has a disease known as lupus. Autoimmune. Her body destroys itself, she's worked hard and if i could i would take her sickness and die.   Were struggling with bills. The medicine she gets cost a lot, and my work doesn't make enough, however.. Im getting sick as well, doctors say it's hard to diagnose. My mother went undiagnosed until around 28 when she nearly died from her sickness.  She went through mutiple life threatening surgeries, and even doctors are surprised she's lived this long. I'm starting to feel the pressure.  Recently me and my mom helped my grandfather through hospice. We made him comfortable, and stayed by his side as they took him off everything. It was so overwhelming. I didn't want to be there so badly but i promised myself. If anyone i love is dying, I'm going to put on a show. Make them feel comfortable, loved, and show them the conviction in my eyes that everything will be okay. I did that.. I cried in my room, then i would watch motivation videos and work out, shower. Then i would watch him until the sun set. What hurt the most.. After a while they stop opening their eyes, talking, but they move their fingers letting you know theyre listening..fuck. I'm hurting so much inside. So on the last day.. I held his hand and i was crying but i tried to sound so confident. I said"" Everything will be okay grandpa, god is watching over you, there is no darkness, only a warm light around you while our loved ones watch. You're not alone, and like i promised. I'll always be by your side."" It was 6 in the morning. The sun was rising. Surprisingly sunday. I got up and opened the blinds, i told him"" I can tell today is going to be a good day (he would always ask and admire nature outside), the sun is shining and it has a cool breeze."" I laid my hand on his head, and i noticed his breathing became less.  His breaths, longer pauses than before. Finally, he didn't breath again and i waited 3 long minutes. I broke down so hard.. I went to my room and i couldn't stop crying. I thought why is life like this, we grew up poor, and I've lost so much already.  Then i had to be strong as they came for his body, and so came the funeral which we couldn't even pay, so we had to cremate his body. I dont know if thats how you spell it. We didnt have money to bury him next to my grandma and uncles...  Now my mom is all i have left and she's getting sicker, and i am too. My symptoms have worsened. Doctors think i inherited an autoimmune disease also. I can barely pay for her medicine and my body is failing me. We live in some crappy apartments, if its not my body tearing me down, its my mind from the inside. One or the other. I don't let her see these emotions, she has it rough already. I actually pawned my ps4 to give her a good birthday, so i don't have any games to play but i still come here to talk about games. There's so much more that aches me, but it's too much to write. I'll most likely delete this post soon.. In situations that people break down in, scared or just can't handle the emotions. I stand stern and calm. My family asks me how im able to withstand it. I tell them you have to have conviction in what you believe and feel emotions later. Emotions cloud judgement in dangerous situations. The part i never tell them.. Is that my view of the world is dark, and im completely stressed out, i avoid thinking of the past because ill break, i lost most of my talking skills so i dont have any friends, how im haunted by my life events, how even sometimes i want to die.. Does my voice get through..  Its okay if im lonely, dont have friends, money, i just wanted to live peacefully with the ones i love the most. They're all leaving me, soon ill be alone.  What will this life be worth without them by my side.. I pray god takes me after my mom goes, i dont think i want to live any longer. The pain is too much to endure and the sickness is eating me alive and i cant breathe, im reaching my limits!  Okay, im going to stop now.. I cant even cry for long, This is just a partial stort of my life, one that will ultimately fade because life continues forward.. I know were all faces our challenges. I wish all of you the best out there..",0.9356,positive,anxious

I’m especially sensitive to the situation because of my abusive family so I ended up getting lost thinking about them. I ended up seeing some of my friends after and I vented a little (stopped myself before I got too rambley) and told them “well I have u guys, my kind coworkers, my cousin, etc etc etc etc so im grateful for that” and tears started welling up in my eyes and I really hope I didn’t make them uncomfortable bc I hated every second of it.

8477,sad,I feel like an idiot,hana27,1,"I’ve been talking to this guy for the past couple of weeks, but we don’t text every day. I always let him initiate the conversations because in my past experiences I’ve learned if a guy wants to talk to you, he will. I used to be the girl that initiated conversations with guys all the time just to be left on Read At or ignored so now I’m just in the mindset of letting them show interest in me first before expending my energy.  He doesn’t message me every day but when he does we usually talk quite a bit. Yesterday i broke my rule I tried to initiate the conversation for the first time, he was online but didn’t open my message. It’s been almost a full day and he didn’t reply so now I just feel stupid and needy. I’m just trying to distract myself not trying to make a big deal out of it but I also feel like if someone is interested they won’t screw around and play games like that. I’m gonna move on from him, deleted his messages and his number, but I just wanted to post on here to vent because I’m just tired of wasting energy on people like this. I get that it could be a lot of reasons but now I’m starting to see that I’m just a filler in his life that he wants to talk to only when he’s lonely.",-0.5023,negative,sentimental,0,0

8486,sad,I'm so not ok,beautifulw0man,1,"I'm about to graduate college and I still wasn't able to get a job, (and before you guys suggest anything please be aware that I don't live in the US or UK) I tried applying for mcdonalds a year ago to different branches but not even one accepted me due to my "busy university schedule". I've talked to my professors for advice and they all told me that I should just focus on my studies first (since I study in the top uni in my country) and that the tuition is free so I don't need to work anyway. I have quite a shallow reason for wanting to have a job - it's because I want to buy myself stuff with my own money.   I am a scholar and so I receive bi-annually stipend. But money just disappears so easily! I spend it mostly for transportation (dorm would be even more expensive), for buying food for my mom, dad, and sister to eat out in fancy places, as a treat, and I also like buying a couple of clothes every now and then as a treat for myself for working my ass off even though I have really bad mental health without getting treatment because I simply can't even afford consulting a psychiatrist about it. And I knew that even if I could afford consulting a doctor, I know the meds would be really expensive.   Right now I can't even fix my life because I'm too poor to go out with people and literally don't have time to date / hang out with people because I spend 3 hours traveling daily and I spend practically all day at university. I don't have time anymore. As I've said I study in a top uni and so the workload here is pretty hellish.    I know, it's all my fault for choosing to study here but it's too late to transfer schools now since my expected date of graduation is on June this year.   Fuck being poor. Fuck being depressed.

10733,sad,Feeling sad over taking high school too seriously.,peppa25,1,I used to do too much in high school. It all had to do with worrying about going to college. I ended up in a community college which wasn't bad. I just wish I didn't take AP classes in high school. They ended up counting towards my core classes in college but I wish I just didn't stress myself out. My parents never pushed me to do more than I needed to in school.

10733,sad,Feeling sad over taking high school too seriously.,mafryar2,2,"Hey, reading this hit me hard, because I feel the exact same way.  I dropped out of high school in December. Right up until my last day, I was the epitome of academic grind. I was the editor-in-chief of two clubs. I was in the IB program. I broke my back to get all A’s. In December, I mentally just... broke. It was like a switch was flipped, and I hit rock bottom. After a long talk with my parents, we decided to pull me out of school. Permanently.  Anyway, I got my GED quickly, and am now starting my first semester at my local community college, which I’m proud of. I just feel the same way you do.  I spend a lot of time wondering if maybe, just maybe, I would’ve survived until graduation if I didn’t sacrifice so much just to be academically perfect. If I settled for honors classes and just one club, so that way I could still have fun.   These past few months I’ve just taught myself to stop dwelling on the ‘what-ifs’ and focus on what’s ahead of me instead. Community college is still a great place to go, and I’m proud that you decided to further your education.

I also learned  to slow down so I won't get too stressed. I got my Master's last year and it took me 4 years because I took a class a semester.
