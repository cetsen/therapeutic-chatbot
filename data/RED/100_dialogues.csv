618,MentalHealthSupport,Anyone else frustrated by this?,RoseBunny8,1,"So I posted yesterday that I'm in a relapse of my depression. Today was a lot better than yesterday, which is good.   I'm just wondering if anyone else gets frustrated when people/friends say something to the effect of ""oh I understand needing mental health days"" or ""I've been depressed sometimes too""?  Like I get theyre trying to be helpful and relate to me but having life long depression where every day your fighting your own brain is not the same as needing a ""mental health day"".   Yes I'm doing better today, but better here does not mean I'm all good and everything is solved. It means that I'm having a relatively good day where I can stay awake for more than an hour at a time and it doesnt feeling like every waking moment my brain is not telling me to kill myself or how much I suck.   How does everyone else respond to these well meaning ""I get it"" messages when you really feel like they don't? Do you just smile and nod or try to help them truly understand?",0.9436,positive,joyful,1,1

He tried to be relatable and say he gets anxiety and depression sometimes.   I know he meant well, but I got so angry with him that I ran away. It wasn't until I was hooked up to an IV in the ER from a heat stroke that he realized any normal personal would not have done what I did.

I don't get why when we tell people ""hey I'm not good"" they don't take us seriously and it takes extreme measures to get the message across. Its pretty messed up in my opinion.

1340,MentalHealthSupport,I have to keep myself busy to not get sad but the stress from not relaxing is taking a toll on me.,TerryCrewsLovesYaoi,1,"Im 18 and currently in highschool. I enjoy it but it's tough so I study a lot at home in order to keep my grades up.I also work part time at a fast food restaurant and I'm currently in training to become a manager which is very exciting and would be great to have on my resume so I'm working very hard. Often 25-35 hour weeks. There are also a bunch of tests and things that I have to do at home in order to become a verified manager so my days are usually packed.  I'm also doing what I can to finish homework and get passing grades in school. I promised myself before I took the job a year ago that I can't let it get in the way of my education.  Over all I work and study for a total of 70-90 hours every week and have done so for a few months (not counting the summer ofc). I have fun at work and school and I finish things in time but I have noticed myself becoming tired, sad and stressed whenever I have free time. I also fear I'm no longer fun to be with because of my lack of energy and whenever I'm in social situations outside of school and work, I become tired and sorta quite fast. Whenever I'm by myself watching TV or playing video games or whatever I do to relax, I get anxiety and become super stressed. This started happening a few months ago but it's been gradually becoming worse.  Whenever I actually get an opportunity to relax, I feel myself becoming stressed and sad so I find something else to do. I'm now always trying to keep myself busy in order to not get anxious but not taking the time to sleep and relax is obviously making the stress worse.  I feel like I'm in a bad loop where I have to keep myself busy all the time but I'm stressed out over not having enough time to relax.  I haven't talked to anybody about this. Any advice is appreciated!  Thank you.",0.5572,positive,anticipating,1,1

1048,MentalHealthSupport,I'm getting a bit worried,ChocoMilk996,1,"Hello, everyone. Is it normal for me to pick at my skin multiple times a day? I have acne and I can't get my hands off my face or even the rest of my body. I pick at my scabs to the point of drawing blood sometimes and it's strange but oddly satisfying in a way. It's caused me a lot of scarring and I think it only makes the picking worse. I had a similar habit in the past as a kid when I would pluck out my hair and eyelashes, but I eventually controlled those urges. I find that playing games keeps my hands occupied but not for long. Tomorrow I'm heading to the store for a stress ball maybe that could help. What do you guys think?",0.2168,positive,grateful,1,1
1048,MentalHealthSupport,I'm getting a bit worried,hpnerd2,2,"Hello! It may just be a bad habit, but there’s also a name for a mental illness for this. (I’m a psych major so I’ve studied it before in college). The name of it is Excoriation disorder. It may help to research it. BUT if it is just a habit, I’ve had it as one (never the disorder). For me, I had to self examine to see why I was doing it. I learned it as a coping skill when my anxiety got too much. Whenever I noticed it happening, I told myself to stop. Over time, it got easier. I tended to do it on my arms and fingers so I wear longer sleeves and paint my nails really nice too. So for your face, you could try makeup or just being proud of a really good skin routine.

670,MentalHealthSupport,Pyromania?..,_HiddenMask_,1,"I have recently spoken to a phsyciatrist (forced :) about these issues and he recommended admitting me into a hospital out of safety reasons. Of course because of pricing being high we couldn't really say no or yes until we're sure it's absolutely necessary.   So lately for the past what.. About a month or two? I've been using fire as an outlet. Burning things began with candles and went onto paper, then notebooks, and now books as large as dictionaries. I won't really go into detail on emotions during the moments, but I know it helps. Sometimes it's difficult to hold back heavy urges to burn myself or others. Though holding back didn't work very long and I now have marks from either dripping hot wax onto myself or holding my hand above flames.   My mother and friends have called me names because of it.. ""Weirdo"" ""Pyroboy"" ""Firehead""   How do I know when far is too far? Im not really sure whether I WANT help or not, but at what point should I seek it?",0.8988,positive,hopeful,0,1

2347,MentalHealthSupport,Should I even keep trying to improve my grades? (And over shenanigans),OWLINGMOON90,1,"Well I’ve kinda hit a wall at the moment. I’ve been getting low grades no matter how hard I try, I suffering from limitations. To make it worse I spend most of my time by myself at school and kept up in the solitude of my room. And yeah it’s lonely, I’m an introvert but I’m just so damn lonely. I know that I have a girlfriend who loves me but why isn’t she here when I need her the most. I don’t blame her I just wish I could just let her know, if I do, I don’t know if she’ll listen or care and that’s what I’m scared about. That’s why I can’t message her. I’m scared even more because if I’m not open with communication in my relationship I risk losing her. I don’t know what to do I’m lost (mentally) and im scared and yet again I have no one to talk to. I don’t want to have another depressive season, it’s one of the most important years, year 12, for me. It reflects my future career. I just cant get depressed again and I’m scared if I do I’ll lose all that I worked for.",-0.9834,negative,anticipating,1,1

They tell you you’ll have good and bad days. They don’t tell you how dark and lonely the bad ones are, or how isolated and scared they make you feel. They tell you, you might have trouble sleeping. They don’t tell you about all the 3am breakdowns you’ll endure, or how everything seems worse at night. They tell you, you may loose your appetite. They don’t tell you about the days that you don’t even have the energy to eat, or how sick food can make you feel. They tell you, you’ll be tired sometimes. They don’t tell you how it doesn’t matter how much you sleep you’ll always feel exhausted, or that some days you’ll be so tired even brushing your hair is a mountain to climb. They tell you, you may become distant from others. They don’t tell you it’s because you feel unworthy enough to enjoy the company of others, or how sometimes you just can’t face the world. They tell you, you might feel the need to harm yourself. They don’t tell you about the shame you feel as you purposely hurt your body, or the need to have some control over your life as it spirals - even if that way is inflicting pain.

What tends to happen is that, when I don't talk to people, my brain starts to develop different personas to recuperate for the lack of social groups I experience in my daily life. And now, with this whole quarantine going on, it had only gotten worse.

I will either not sleep or sleep too much, and 90% of the time when I shut my eyes, my brain shouts back at me. I've tried melatonin, valerian, and some other stuff I can't really remember. The only thing that seems to work these days is sticking on YouTube or an audiobook and shutting my eyes. The talking makes my mind listen, and if it's something I've seen/heard a million times before, it knocks me out within an hour or two, which is practically miraculous for me. I'm not a professional, or any kind of sleep expert, just someone who suffers with severe intrusive thoughts.

398,MentalHealthSupport,Ovwhelmed and lack of motivation,fake_zealer,1,"I have a lot going on in my life. I'm 17 years old and I'm currently in foster care. I just got admitted to university this past week, I'm struggling with a couple of my highschool classes, and I'm dealing with the trauma of my past. (You gotta be in foster care for a reason.)   I've been in foster care for over a while (it'll be a year in march) and I say I've been handling things pretty well. I have only had less than a handful of instances where I broke down and cried.   But since I got admitted into university all of that has pretty much changed. I've been hit full on in the face with reality and its super hard. I've found that I have no real motivation for life other than ensuring my future happens. It's hard for me to get homework done and for me to keep trudging on.   I've just been so overwhelmed that I'm really depressed and have been feeling suicidal. I'm barely holding onto my sanity by a mere few threads.   Like just tonight, I had finished cooking dinner for my family and I sat down to eat. I had my headphones on and was watching youtube. But my foster mom a few feet away was shrillingily talking super loud. She just wouldn't shut up and it just sent me over the brim. (Plus my younger sister was just super sassy with me.) I ended up rushing up the stairs only to cry my eyes out, totally freaked out.  Normally shit like that wouldn't upset me but the noise just totally overwhelmed me.  I have a good relationship with my foster parents and I'm normally super open to talking with them, but I'm scared to mention the suicidal part to my foster parents because that is taken super seriously.   I just don't know what to do. I'm currently in therapy but its biweekly and doesn't do much. Does anyone have any advice for finding motivation as well as helping with the overwhelming feeling?
