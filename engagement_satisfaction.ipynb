I was on my way home after an evaluation ( dont worry everyone,  still nutty) and i stop by the grocery store to pick up a few things. . and the cashier says, \" we pay for that, dont we?\" in relation to my purchase. How in the hell did a cashier know i was on disability? Giving me a reason, without an identifiable motive is a good way to get yourself hurt. Keep it up.   \n",
