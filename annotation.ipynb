       "104107  I want to start by saying this is **not** a call for help.  Currently I'm part, along with 11 other guys, of a very exclusive one-year-long course provided by the government of my country in order to be part of a very exclusive branch of said government. This course is very demanding, imagine *The Pursuit of Happyness*, but with less homelessness and with more available positions (10).   I've always wanted to be part of this specific branch, it is my dream, I went to the university specifically to be there, and now, at 29, I finally have a shot at it. I'm doing quite good so far, and the competition for a position is getting lighter (originally we were 13, and one of the current guys is probably dropping out soon), but the real problem of course is the competition against myself, there is always the possibility of having a Fail grade somewhere that can take me out of the race. I'm doing my best in order to avoid such outcome, but shit happens, and some ugly shit has happened to me ...   \n",
