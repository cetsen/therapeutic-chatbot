I'm doing quite good so far, and the competition for a position is getting lighter (originally we were 13, and one of the current guys is probably dropping out soon), but the real problem of course is the competition against myself, there is always the possibility of having a Fail grade somewhere that can take me out of the race. I'm doing my best in order to avoid such outcome, but shit happens, and some ugly shit has happened to me ...   \n",

       "0  I recently got out of a 3 month relationship with someone I thought was \"the one\" since we had known each other for a long time and had similar personalities but for some reason or another we were never able to date until recently we tried it out, things were good but once we had our first argument be showed me his true colors and I decided to end it. It destroyed my self-esteem since I already battle with depression and anxiety, mainly around trusting and meeting people.   Today I hardly wore makeup and went to my local store for some groceries. This random guy out of the blue began making conversation with me and ended asking me for a date, for some reason I felt a good vibe coming off him and accepted. I am excited and genuinely feel good about the possibilities.   Thanks for reading.    TLDR: title says it all   \n",
